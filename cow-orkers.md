> So if your air conditioner goes on the fritz, or your washing machine blows up, or your video recorder conks out, before you call the repairman, turn on all the lights, check all the closets and cupboards, look under all the beds, 'cause you never can tell. There just might be a gremlin in your house.   
> -- Rand Peltzer, Gremlins (1984)

Who could believe that even after getting multiple people to look over the rules, some of which provided error-checking in detail that (a) some of their suggestions I managed to completely overlook and (b) others were missed by all and sundry. It is almost as if the computer itself *hid* the text that needed editing from our view, as it knew that if such a publication made it to the light of day that *we* would be on to *them*. But that's just crazy talk, right? 

Whether crazy or sane, or most likely somewhere in between, here is the list of errata that has been caught *so far*.

**1.6 Skills and Knowledges**

Rolled Wealth: Under character class backgrounds where it reads "Perception", this should be "Sense (various)", which can be distributed as desired.

Hobby: The core rules say that a Hobby "... cannot be used as a replacement for an existing skill or knowledge, and by definition, represents an amateur activity." A character can, however, use an existing skill as replacement for Hobby acquired as part of their background. For example, whilst one cannot have Hobby (English) because there is alread an English skill, a character can use of Hobby skill ranks acquired through childhood and adolescence in Language (English) instead. Hobbies can also be used to replace professionally acquired skills, i.e., they always costs 1 Skill Point.

Intellect Fortress: Observant-management types may notice that this appears twice with two different descriptions. Surprisingly, both apply! A manager (or some other weird home-brew character profession) may have either activiated at a particular but not both. By default characters with an Intellect Fortress operating will use it to gain bonus the hit points. However, if a manager so chooses, they can make an inspiring speech, shedding those hit points and distributing the +2 bonus across all those that have heard it (*not* including the Manager themselves). The loss of their own bonus is because the speech was so inspiring, so heartfelt, that they've opened themselves up to an attack by others. Also, note that the Manager must still have bonus hit points left from the default version of the Intellect Fortress. 

**1.7 Perks**

File system knowledge provides a +2 bonus for research and perception skill checks in their current place of employment and a +1 bonus in prior places of employment.

**2.2 The Resistentialist Environment**

All references to the "Brawl" skill refer to the mellee skills and all specialisations, including Brawling.

The rules for a character holding their breath should be twice their Strength score, not twice their Constitution.

**2.3 Tactical Conflict**

Tactical conflict is initiated when a character (PC or NPC) declares it as such. Other characters present may make a Sense skill check with a target number of 11 in standard situations

**3.7 Bestiary**

Dogs are listed as having 'Movement (flight)' 8-15. This should simply read 'Movement'. Dogs don't fly. Although if you do want to include a flying dog in your world, name it Laika and give it wings like Icarus.

## 0.4 2D6 Revisited

Who knew that 2D6 could be so interesting? When the chance of success table was included in the original rules (4.2 Episode and Season Design) one would think that would the end of it. The game uses 2d6, like the original cartoon, versus target number. What could be more simple? OK, 1d6 could be more simple, Or flip a coin. Or make it up as you go along. You get the point. But no, math nerds crawl out from behind non-Euclidean corners and demand further elaboration on the mighty 2d6. So here it is.

A 1d6 roll provides a discrete random variable (not 'discreet' as one post-graduate econometrics course suggested), which can be expected, based on rational elaboration, or . Each d6 has the numbers 1 to 6 with equal probability, which establishes its *range* as 6 and the *random variable* in each case as X_1, X2, X3 etc. The *mean* (which is often expressed as *average*) of the random variables from 1d6 is 3.5; not 3 which is commonly thought. The mean is determined by adding all probabilities and dividing, i.e., 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21/6 = 3.50. A quick way of calculating the mean of die rolls is to add the highest and lowest expected values and divide by 2 i.e. 1 + 6 = 7 / 2 = 3.5. The *median* for 1d6 is the mid-point of the distribution of possible results i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. In this case there is no rolled mid-point as it is a range from 3-4. The *mode* is the most commonly occuring value in a distribution. Whilst actual rolled results may generate such a distribution there is no mode from expected results, which would provide an equal distribution of all potential values.

This is all easy so far? Just like *Fox in Socks*, right?

> *Fox in Socks*, Dr. Seuss, 1965

The opportunity is taken here to dispel one alarmingly common misconception which, fortunately, seems to be more common among the general public rather than gamers in particular, and that refers to the probability of results on multiple dice tests. From a single die, the probability of rolling any specific number from 1d6 is 1/6. Likewise the probability of rolling any specific number from subsequent dice from 1d6 is 1/6. It doesn't matter if you have rolled six 1s in a row or 10 6s in a row. "What are the odds?", you might ask - 1 in 6, *each* time, and the chance of you rolling a 1 or a 6 on the next die roll is also 1/6 for a 1 and 1/6 for a 6. *Dice don't have memory*. Unless of course, you have *very special* dice.

> First, I'll make a quick trick brick stack.   
> Then I'll make a quick trick block stack.   
> You can make a quick trick chick stack.   
> You can make a quick trick clock stack.   

Having established *range*, *mean*, *median*, and *mode*, the opportunity is taken to initially elaborate this to *variance*. Variance is a measure of distibution, specifically the expected (or actual, if want to generate a rolled, empirical result) of the squared deviation of a random variable from the mean. Or, if you wish to hear in another form, first calculate the mean of the square then subtract the square of the mean. If that sounds confusing is perhaps easier to illustrate by equation, initially using 1d6 as an example, and then elaborating to 2d6. Because each die is independent (dice don't have memory, remember) the variance of n-dice is n times 1d6.

Mean of the square =  (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2)/6 = 91/6 = 15.17
Variance = (91/6) - (7/2)^2 = 35/12

Var(X), 1d6 = (1 + 3.5)^2 * 1/6 + (2 + 3.5)^2 * 1/6 + .. + (6 + 3.5)^2 * 1/6  = 70/24 = 35/12 = 2.92
Var(X), 2d6 = 35/12 + 35/12 = 70/12 = 5.83
Var(X), nd6 = n * 35/12

Broadly speaking, if there's a low variance it means the sums of the dice rolls will be relatively close together and if there's a wide variance it means that there that there's more frequent deviations. If you want to see nerds having aneurysms read a debate on which is more 'realistic'; 3d6 or d20 or 2d10. Of course, it depends whether you're trying to simulate something that have a lot of variance, not very little, or how you're treating modifiers. *Papers & Paychecks* uses 2d6 for aesthetic purposes, and that's all there is to it. That aesthetic choice does come with a couple of matters of importance; there is relatively less influence on randomness in the game, and modifiers are significantly more important.  

One other matter that gamers love for obvious reasons is working out percentage of ranges. This can be expressed from the *standard deviation* which is the square root of the variance, that is, for a single dice sqrt(35/12). For 2d6 the value is sqrt(70/12) = c2.42 etc. The standard deviation means that around 34.1% of results will be within 1 standard deviation from the mean, and additional 13.5% within two and so forth. So from around 5-9 on 2d6 will take up roughly 68% of all results.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Standard_deviation_diagram.svg" title="From GliderMaven on Wikipedia, CCA 2.5">

The initial exploration of 1d6 can be extended to 2d6. IN the following, the random variable X is the sum of the numbers of 2d6. For example, when 4 and 6 are rolled, X is equal to 10, or if 2 and 5 are rolled the result is 7. If one was to create a table of 1d6 plus 1d6 with the results cross-references there would be 36 (6*6) possible outcomes, ranging from 2 (1 and 1 on each die) to 12 (6 and 6 on each die). The value *f* is defined as, the frequencies associated with the possible values of X. For example, there are four outcomes where X is equal to 5 i.e., (4,1 ; 3,2 ; 2,3 ; 4,1). 

> Let's have a little talk about tweetle beetles....

The full set of frequencies for X are as follows, along with the probability. The probability for X is highest at X and declines from this mean. The value E(X) is defined as the expected value of X, which is : E (X) = x_1 p_1 + ... + x_n p_n, or Sigma_(i=i)^n x_i p_i, or mu_x. The expected value of a random variable, such as X, is also known as its population mean. It is the weighted average of its possible values, the weights being the probabilities attached to the values. Abstract values (x_1, p_1, x_1p_1) are provided first. The concrete values of x_i are the same as in the column X, and the concrete values of p_i are the same as in column p. The expected value, E(X), is the sum of the entries in the column x_ip_i), or in this case 252/36, or 7, which you probably already knew. And that's about enough of statistical elaborations on 2d6. Roll some dice and have fun.

# 1.0 Additional Character Classes

*Papers & Paycheck* can be a very adaptable game system. Whilst the character professions in the core rulebook as designed to be a broad representation of the various jobs found in a workplace, it has been pointed out that there were other professions that don't quite fit the standard workplace environment. Thus, a few more niche professions are offered here for such games.

## 1.1 Sporting Professions

### 1.1.1 The Athlete

Prime Requisite: Strength
Starting Age: 15+1d4
Profession Skills: Athletics (Strength), Athletics (Stamina), Intimidate, Jump, Melee, Swim, Knowledge (General), Profession, Carousing, Sense (various) 

Description: An professional athlete engages in competitive sports which involve strength, endurance, or speed for their livelihood. Like the labourer they are not always known for their intellect, but their physical prowess is unsurpassed, which can make them very popular in some social situations such as the participation in "paired athletics". An athlete is, of course, vary rare in the usual settings of *Papers & Paychecks* but they are not unknown in some contexts or as a past profession. Like labourers, athletes gains points in physical characteristics as their level improves. Athletes have an extremely low base wage, but this is off-set by receiving double their attribute bonus (or penalty is a weedy person decides to be come an athelete) to this wage. The starting age of athlete with no prior profession is often quite young.

| Level | Wage     | Perks			|
|-------|----------|----------------------------|
| 1	| $700     | +1 Run and +0.25 Swim Move |
| 2	| $800     | +1 to STR or PER	        |
| 3	| $900     | +2 Physical Hit Points     |
| 4	| $1000    | +1 to STR or DEX           |
| 5	| $1100    | +1 Run or +0.25 Swim Move  |
| 6	| $1150    | +1 to STR or PER           |
| 7	| $1200    | Adoring Fans		|
| 8	| $1250    | Conference Attendance      |
| 9	| $1300    | Team Captain		|
| 10	| $1350    | Superannuation		|

### 1.1.2 Agent

Prime Requisite: Intelligence
Starting Age: 15+3d4
Profession Skills: Act, Administration, Craft (Computing), Craft (writing), Gamble, Insight, Knowledge (Laws), Knowledge (General), Language (various)

Description: A sports agent acts as the legal representative of other sporting professions, making recommendations and negotiating for pay and benefits. As can be expected the often work for a commission of the sporting professionals salary (around 5-10% is typical) and will often have some legal background. The sporting agent is often depicted as being sly although empirical studies backing this conventional wisdom are lacking. This may because the agent is typically older than the sportsperson, understands the law better, and is more intelligent - all of which results in much better pay that those they represent. In conventional *Papers & Paychecks* games the Agent is probably more commonly encountered than other sporting professionals due to their interactions with the corporate world.

| 8	| $1900    | Multitasking	|
| 9	| $2200    | Apprentice		|
| 10	| $2500    | Superannuation    	|


### 1.1.3 Coach

Prime Requisite: Wisdom 
Starting Age: 21+3d4 
Profession Skills: Intimidate, Investigate, Knowledge (General), Concentration, Hobby (Sport), Profession, Sense (Sight), Inspire, plus one of Athletics (Strength)., Athletics (stamina), Firearms., Gymnastics., Missiles., or Ride.

Description: A coach trains athletes. The skills associated with a coach are typically those that the athlete has as well, but the coach doesn't have the same sort of physical prowess, at least not anymore. Coaches are often retired athletes who impart their knowledge on to the young and upcoming. This requires a professional skill that is not unlike teaching, but also the capacity to inspire or, if that fails, intimidate, the athlete into completing their tasks. There is a sense in which coaches live vicariously through their athletes, and then there are those who will are sufficiently unscrupulous that they will set up their athlete to take a fall for success at the bookmakers.

| Level | Wage     |  Perks		|

| 1	| $600     | Id Insinuation	|
| 2	| $700     | Ego Whip         	|

| 7	| $1650    | Project Manager	|
| 8	| $1900    | Apprentice 	|
| 9	| $2200    | +1 INT or WIS	|
| 10	| $2500    | Superannuation    	|


### 1.1.4 Gymnast or Equestrian

Prime Requisite: Dexterity 
Starting Age: 14+1d4 
Profession Skills: Athletics (Strength)., Athletics (stamina)., Climb., Jump., Gymnastics., Ride., Sleight., Stealth, Sense (Balance)

Description: A gymnast or equestrian are athletes that specialised in bodily movement, whether their own or that of their mount. Whilst Dexterity is their primary characteristic they will often will have high scores in Strength as well. In addition, the Gymnast will also have additional concentration on a Sense (Balance) skill, which typically provides a bonus to the gymnastics skill or its specialisations, where as the Equestrian will have greater values in Ride. With a heavy emphasis on physical skills, gymnasts are trained young and enter professional life younger than any other. It also means that they are the characters most likely to retire young too, as their body collapses from contortions or they fall of their horse just that one time to many.

> Sky News Reporter: the difficulty There is of course that you've compared the dangers of ecstasy to horse riding so you see what you say falls down a little when you talk about hard scientific evidence...whether if I may say so crass comment like that   
> Dr. David Nutt (sacked Chair of the UK Home Office's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs): Well obviously you haven't read the paper have you? but it's not a crass comment that was a carefully considered analysis and you know how many people die every year from horse riding accident in this
country? It's over 30; of ecstasy is about 10 about proportions a proportion   
> Sky News Reporter: About proportions now are you?    
> Dr. David Nutt: A proportion of users? Oh yes, if you read my paper you'll seem particularly venting so hard, horse riding there's a serious
accident every 35 hours and with ecstasy it's about a serious event every 350,000 hours. So this is the part of the issue here; you are trying to argue the science. You're not a scientist. We've done the analysis, we've looked at it. If you don't like what we say about the science, we'll say ok we will make, we'll take a moral position. But don'try to tell me that the science we've done is wrong. My committee had 28 people. We did the most detailed analysis of ecstasy, the most detailed analysis of cannabis, ever done. We know what the harms are...   
> Sky News Reporter: But do you not see that the headlines that come out of the science that you described? You're quite right I haven't read your paper..."

### 1.1.5 Shooter

Prime Requisite: Perception 
Starting Age: 15+1d4
Profession Skills: Athletics (Strength)., Athletics (stamina)., Concentration., Craft (mechanical)., Firearms., Knowledge (general)., Missiles, Sense (various), Sleight.

Description: What would be a favourite character profession in other RPGs is often overlooked in *Papers & Paychecks* due to the lack of obvious oportunities to blow things up at range. This profession incorporates any number of thrown skills, usually incorporated in Athletics (Strength), the use of human-powered missile weapons (e.g., archery), and the use of firearms. Whilst the primary characteristic is PER, often characters will seek a high DEX and STR as well; even a javelin thrower needs to be able to see their target. All this asise, shooters are one active sporting profession which do not seem to attract the attention of many fans, and they probably prefer it that way.

### 1.1.6 Cheerleader

Prime Requisite: Charisma 
Starting Age: 15+1d4 
Profession Skills: Act., Carousing., Inspire., Seduce., Athletics (Strength)., Athletics (stamina)., Jump., Profession., Insight

Description: The fan-contributed character profession that led your author to go down the rabbit-hole of developing an entire set of 'sporting professions'. The cheerleader inspires athletes and fans alike nominally through leading cheers, chants, and song, but more than often through their through their atheletic maneuvers where the sheer beauty in motion often leaves the fans in a bit of a stupor - which curiously is counter-productive to the actual purpose of leading a cheer. When said fans come to, however their determination to cheer is typically enhanced due to the ecstastic experience of the cheer. Cheerleaders have CHA as their primary characteristic, but like other athletes, DEX and STR are of a high priority as well. Note that due to the various athletic maneuvers expected of them, Cheerleaders are one of the most dangerous sporting professions.

| Level | Wage     |  Perks			|

## 1.2 Fantasy Professions

### 1.1.1 Fighter

Prime Requisite: Strength
Starting Age: 15+1d4
Profession Skills: Athletics (Strength)., Athletics (stamina)., Intimidate., Jump., Melee., Survival., Missiles., Carousing., Stealth

Description: The Fighter is any number of warrior professions whose job it is to live by bashing things and to die by bashing things, hence their nickname as "meat shields", meaning they should stay at the front of the battle and hit things and be hit. In the quasi-European-medieval-Tolkien-Conan soup that is Generic Fantasy RPGs this role is so important that they often find themselves in a leadership role both within parties or for societies as a whole. A careful obsever will notice that Fighters are the only profession that can reach the giddy heights of owning land and title (but see Cleric, below).

### 1.1.2 Wizard

Prime Requisite: Intelligence
Starting Age: 15+3d4
Profession Skills: Craft (alchemical)., Craft (writing)., Investigate., Knowledge (Philosophy)., Knowledge (General)., Language (various)., Craft (mechanical)., Craft (structural)., Insight

Description: Older and wiser than most other in General Fantasy the Wizard is a profession both subtle and wise, meaning that they are weak and ignorant. Barely aware of which end of a sword is the pointy one, a wizard encapsulates much of the knowledge that is appropriate for the period, which means a very large book of many blank pages. This said, they do have the saving grace of at least knowing a few things about the world on account of the fact they can read and write, plus they have various magical abilities expressed as perks. Sometimes these even work, albeit not quite as intended.

### 1.1.3 Cleric

Prime Requisite: Wisdom
Starting Age: 15+3d4
Profession Skills: Craft (writing)., Investigate., Knowledge (Laws)., Knowledge (General)., Administration., Concentration., Profession., Survival., Bully

Description: If anyone was looking for "a certain resemblance to religious orders of knighthood in medieval times", go see the Fighter profession. This is a Cleric, a member the clergy, who engages in clerical work, both in the religious and administrative sense, and whose primary social function is to provide a moral framework and guidance for the rest of society (which is why they have "Bully" as a professional skill).  In the Generic Fantasy world, the gods are real, numerous, and somewhat interventionist, so being an atheist is quite delusionary. The Cleric's perks are social and magical.

### 1.1.4 Rogue

Prime Requisite: Dexterity
Starting Age: 15+1d4
Profession Skills: Climb., Jump., Melee., Swim., Craft (mechanical)., Gymnastics., Missiles., Sleight., Stealth

Description: Quick of hand, foot, and mind, the Rogue is a profession that develops skills in acquiring chattels and possessions from others. Almost inevitably such characters will draw themselves to the attention of the lawful forces which exist nominally to protect such improper transactions or the organised syndicates that seek to regulate it. Either way any period of time as a professional Rogue will lead a character into membership of the notorious Guild which does come with its own numerous advantages - and at higher levels one can be surprised to discover that they do stick together in a peverse sense of corrupt solidarity.

### 1.1.4 Ranger

Prime Requisite: Perception
Starting Age: 15+2d4
Profession Skills: Athletics (stamina)., Melee., Swim., Ride., Survival., Knowledge (General)., Missiles, Insight., Sense (various)

Description: Eschewing the comforts of civilisation in favour of the rough and rugged lifestyle of a leaky shack, a few old skins for blankets, and an astounding lack of personal hygeine, the Ranger is a well-known kook who lives away from most other people in preference to the company of wild beasts, which inevitably leads to many jokes about their sexual preferences. This is not helped by the fact that a great number of their perks are based around seemingly magical abilities to establish friendships with animals and communicate with them. Still, jokes aside, the Ranger is definitely the go-to person if you want to need to travel through dangerous wilds - and there is plenty of that in the Generic Fantasy world.

| Level | Wage     | Perks		|

### 1.1.4 Bard

Prime Requisite: Charisma
Starting Age: 15+2d4
Profession Skills: Act., Carousing., Inspire., Lie., Seduce., Craft (writing)., Knowledge (Arts)., Knowledge (General)., Language (various)
 
Description: A bard, to use contemporary parlance, is a combination of rock-star and odd-ball intellectual, capable of spinning mighty yarns that actually have an element of truth - but never of a prosaic truth. Bards are determined to discover the weird and wonderful, strange lands and customs, and equally determined to enlighten others about such things. The propensity to provide such information as artistic performance, song, poetry, etc is a source of frustration for more narrow scholars, but that is part of their entertainment as well.

## 1.3 Skill Options and Elaborations

**Languages**

> "A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot"   
> "A language is a dialect with an army and navy"   
> -- popularised by Max Weinreich

In the core rules the language skill is treated as a knowledge skill with required specialisations, with the comment "closely related languages will have a close default with each other". There is, however, no rules for this degree of specialisation or the modifications for closely related languages. 

As one of many lapses into a degree of hard-nosed simulationism that is a feature of *Papers & Paychecks* the following can be used to represent the distance from the specific language skill. Note as the quote indicates that there is no hard rule on what constitutes differentiates a dialect and a language, rather they represent a continuum which is abstracted here.

A *dialect* (very high degree of mutual intelligibility, regional differences, status or subculture keywords etc) has a -1 modifier. An example would be Low and High German. When a character learns a language they may optionally select a dialect of that language that they have specialised in.

A *sister* language (substantial degree of mutual intelligibility, but considered separate languages) has a -2 modifier. For example, Afrikaans and Dutch.

A *related* language (medium degree of mutual intelligibility, a branch of the same language family), has a -4 modifier. An example would be French and Spanish, which are both Romance languages. Related languages are grouped as subdivisions of the wider extended language family (e.g., Indo-European would include Indo-Iranian, Germanic, Hellenic, Celtic, Balto-Slavic, Romance, etc)

A *distantly related* language (very low degree of mutual intelligibility, part of the same extended family group), has a -8 modifier. An example would be Spanish and Russian. Extended language families include Sino-Tibetan, Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Japonic, Austronesian)

Between *unrelated* languages (no degree of mutual intelligibility, different language family) linguistic communication is not possible. Try charades. 

Note that depending on the complexity of a language and cultural exposure mutual intelligibility can vary in direction ("asymmetric intelligibility"). For example, For a Dutch speaker, Afrikaans would count as a dialect with a -1 modifier, however for an Afrikaans speaker, Dutch is a sister language with a -2 modifier. This is because Afrikaans has a simpler grammar. Likewise, with a greater exposure, a speaker of Scots understands other dialects of English as a dialect, whereas an American in Scotland may initially find it a sister language with a -2 modifier.

> "The secretar gree’d tae gie me a haund in the airtin o the dreich policie an its pittin intil effect."   
> "The secretary agreed to help me in the direction of the dreary policy and to put it in effect".

The language continuum can also represent temporal changes. For example, Early Modern English (the English of the King James Bible, or Shakespearean English) can be considered a dialect, Middle English (Chaucerian) as a sister language, and Old English (Anglo-Saxon) as a related language.

As an auxillary language, Esperanto is a sister language to all Germanic or Romance languages

The following is a list of the top fifteen languages in the world by total number of speakers (first language and additional) and some major default values. Note that in some cases the "sister language" (e.g., Hindi and Urdu) refers to the written form only and in terms of a spoken language they are dialects. .

The degree of complexity of the communication establishes the Target Number. Note how the sentence, technically identical all along, becomes more complex in terms of noun-specificity and conditional verbal expression, starting from a simple present-tense subject-verb-object, generic noun. Inspired by the language functions chart from *RuneQuest* (third edition, 1984)

> No one gets angry at a mathematician or a physicist whom he or she doesn't understand at all, or at someone who speaks a foreign language, but rather at someone who tampers with your own language, with this 'relation,' precisely, which is yours.  
-- Jacques Derrida    

As a practical implementation of linguistic issues according to theme of *Papers & Paychecks* the Boss should consider applying issues of mistranslation as often as possible. There is the classic example of the "water sheep" as a transliteration of "hydraulic ram" in Philip K. Dick's "The Galatic Pot Healer" (1969), which received special attention in the "Camp 22" scenario in this publication. Another potential situation is to applying different legal applications in a multi-lingual country, such as the apocryphal story of the Luxembourg police using German to follow their procedures and French for their legal code. For actual examples, do consider these real-world failures of translation engines and incorporate them into your scenarios.

1. "Fall" and "autumn". In English "fall" and "autumn" refer to a season, the former more common in American English, the latter in Commonwealth English and from Germanic and Latin origins respectively. A problem arises in many translations where documents may deliberate on strategies for "fall prevention" which translate into "autumn prevention" (e.g., in Spanish "prevención de otoño"). PC Workers may be sent on a mission by Occupational Health & Safety to ensure that the office environment is "autumn proof".

2. In the north-western region of Spain the local language is Galacian. In the town of As Pontes they hold annual rapini festival, a leafy green vegetable, whose name in Galacian is "grelo"; which is also archiac slang in Portuguese for the word "clitoris". In 2015 the town happily advertised the upcoming gastronomic festival of the grelo. Bon appetit!

3. Literal translations rather than idiomatic translations can cause significant problems. They are also the sort of thing which are easily applied when a character just makes their skill roll in a foreign language. For example, the French phrase "Se taper le cul par terre", which is their equivalent of "rolling on the floor laughing". The literal translation is "Banging your arse on the ground".

4. Sometimes this can go the other way as well. The former Australian Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, was well-known for his use of the Australian dialect of English and at one particular ocassion during a speech to a business audience in Tokyo about Australian industrial relations, he remarked: "We're just not interested in playing silly buggers on this issue". This resulted in some shock among the audience as it was later revealed that the translator had converted the speech to "We're just not interested in acting as laughing homosexuals on this issue".

**Passive-Agressive Attack**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpgreview/papersandpaychecks/master/images/passive-aggressive.jpg" />

*"Fine. See if I care."*

A passive-agrressive action is an indirect attack against another character which appeals to their own sense of intelligence and moral rightness rather than direct opposition. The attacker appears passive, or even wronged, evoking a sense of sympathy, when in reality they are the one's engaging in an attack. 

In *Papers & Paychecks* a passive-aggressive attack is a special maneuver using the Act skill which combines both a mental and social attack on a target. It is a tactical action which pits the Act+CHA skill against the WIS of the defender, plus any mental defenses that they can gather. If the defender fails they take the differnence in Mental Bruises. Further, any characters who witness the passive-aggressive attack will also have match their own WIS against the value of the attack. If they fail, the defender takes half damage in Social Bruises due to the sympathy that the observers have.

However being passive-aggressive does develop some risks. If the attack fails, the defender gains the difference as temporary mental hit points as they develop a sense of strength in recognising this type of attack. Likewise if it fails against observers, they will respond by generating half-value social bruises on the attacker. 

In contemporary society passive-aggressive attacks can be carried out by email or in webforums etc. The particular danger of the latter is observers might notice and inform others in the conversation thread. This provides observers the opportunity for a second defense roll with a +2 bonus. In one-to-one email conversations they are particularly effective especially in the faux formality of an office environment.

> Fast fashion stores have become the country’s other favorite obsession. Places like H&M and Forever21 continue to spring up everywhere, and only
continue to rise in popularity. Like fast food restaurants, these companies release new products at a low cost, many times per season, on the promise
of giving us greater access to fashion. 
> But what if that actually is a lie? What if fast fashion doesn’t do us any good, and instead just makes us addicted to cheap, badly made products?

*Cloak of Protection* The fine cloak, jacket, stoll, or similar item is well-made and expensive, regardless of whether from acrylics of actual fur from some dead marmot, mink, or even a cute bunny. The in game effect however is that the items is particularly averse to being separated from its owner, who tends to wear it even in unseasonal times, and it will go to great lengths to prevent the owner from harm (because if the owner is harmed, that will mean separation). A series of gradual mental bruise attacks are carried out on the owner, at a maximum rate of one per strategic turn, with an attack value of INT 12. The cloak has an usual ESP value to determine when the character has already taken some mental damage and strike accordingly. The objective is to prevent the owner from taking any risks whatsoever. By the time they'reduced to 0 Mental Hit Points on Bruises the owner will be notable risk adverse. The Cloak will continue its attacke even at this stage, seeking to reduce the character to 0 Mental Hit Points on Wounds, at which point the character will be spending their entire life in their room lovingly attached to their "Cloak of Protection". ENC 2, cost $1000

*Manual/Website of Pain*: This manual or website is a necessary, long, and critical document that the PC Worker has to read, courtesy of a requirement from their boss. It might be a legal contract, an device operation manual, an OH&S requirements checklist. Regardless, it will take 3 strategic turns to complete. However the grave problem with the manual is that it contains the mystical power of multiple insanity-inducing typographical attacks. In the first strategic turn the manual attacks with an INT of 12 with the two attacks of poor kerning and a gratious use of Comic Sans, each of which does 1d4 Mental Bruises. In the second strategic turn there are hanging paragraphs and paragraphs of *lorem ipsum* text, which attack wih an INT of 14 and causing 1d6 Mental Brusies each. Finally, in the third strategic turn it is discovered that the document has broken indexing (or dead hyperlinks) and acronyms without elaboration or glossary. These attack with an INT of 16 and cause 1d4 Mental Wounds. *The Manual/Website of Pain* costs $100, either as a specialist book (ENC 1) or as a web-subscription service.

*Potion of Animal Control*: A curious alcoholic beverage, usually of a mid-strength cheap beer or white wine, requires by to be drunk by the "animal". An "animal" in this case being a particularly festive college-aged indvidual. Once consumed the "animal" will effectively have no resistance to the provider of the beverage for 32 rounds for animals of 01-05 CON, half that time for 06-15 CON, and a quarter of that time for CON 16-25, etc. ENC 1, cost $5 (for the drink) + $995 if the control properties are known.

*Potion of Dragon Control*: Another curious alcoholic beverage, usually a cheap sweet sherry or rot-gut whiskey, requires to be drunk by the "dragon". A "dragon" in this case being a particularly odious mother- or father-in-law. Once consumed the "dragon" will effectively have no resistance to the provider of the beverage for 32 rounds for animals of 01-05 CON, half that time for 06-15 CON, and a quarter of that time for CON 16-25, etc. ENC 1, cost $5 (for the drink) + $995 if the control properties are known.

*Potion of Fire Breath*: A rarefied commercial chilli sauce with a Scoville rating of some 3 million units, the consumption of even a drop of potion of fire breath will cause a wound per drop consumed and will cause a bruise to anyone the character breathes upon for the next 10 rounds. They will, however, require to make a successful CON roll with a target number of 11 to act each of these round due the excruciating pain that they will be experiencing. ENC 0, cost $20

*Potion of Flying*: From a near-random sample of out-of-date medications a potion of flying is created, or at the very least, the consumer thinks so. A sensible person may think this is dangerous and there is a degree of truth to it. The consumer will have a great sense of euphoria for a strategic turn for characters of CON 06-15, twice that time for characters with CON 01-05, and half that time for characters of CON 16-25, etc. In addition to the euphoria the consumer will experience a high sense of lucidity, which will provide a bonus of +5 to any task that requires intellectual creativity. After the potion of flying wears off however, the character will feel depressed and will have a -5 penalty to such tasks, for twice as long as the original effect of the potion. What goes up, must come down. ENC 0, cost $100

*Rod of Dowsing*: An otherwise L-shaped or Y-shaped stick can be used in to locate ground water, oil, precious metals or gems, and even old gravesites. When used by a person who believes in the superstition, they gain a +5 bonus in discovering what they are searching for. When it is subject to scientific observation, it will fail to operate. ENC 1, cost $5000.

*Staff of Striking*: A staff of striking is specialist targetting weapon that especially affects any characters with levels in Labourer or Tradesperson. The bearer of the staff, upon striking the ground, an attracting the attention of members of said classes within hearing range, will provide a bonus of +5 to attempts to influence said characters but only for the purpose of encouraging them to withdraw their labour from their employer, engage in a "go slow", "monkey-wrenching" or similar activities. The range, of course, is quite effective in a room with wooden floorboards and a high roof, and is less effective outside on a windy day. Use of artificial enhancement of sound and speech is can also help. ENC 2, cost $5000. 

*Vicarious and Vacuous Grimoire*: "Like sands through the hourglass...." This tome provides drama utterly inane and ficticious characters, their relationships, challenges (especially romantic), and intrigues. Whilst utterly bereft of useful information it is also extraordinarily compelling, and any character who so much as reads the first page will have to make a WIS check with a difficulty of 11. If they fail they will spend the next 15 strategic turns doing nothing but reading the story of the Cordroy and Chime families. During this time their INT is reduced by 5, and their CHA by 5 as they insist on trying to tell all and sundry of the tale. Worse still, when completing the book they find there is another volume, which also requires a WIS check to resist purchasing and reading; "It Never Ends". ENC 1, cost $100

*Wand of Lightening*: Through the very strange machinations of the universe, with origins in the failures of automated spell-checkers, when a wand a lightening is directed at a physical object the weight of that object will reduce by 10% as long as the wand is remains directed and the object is not actually weighed. The wonders of paranormal science! ENC 1, cost $2000.

*Wand of Magic Missiles*: This short black wand has white tips, rather like a classic stage magician's item. When engaging in a social attack, the social barbs used by the attacker have the curious effect of causing double damage, i.e., with a successful attack the social bruises, or even wounds, are doubled. The attacker will look quite foolish of course, pointing a stick at a person in an argument, but they are surprisingly convincing. ENC 1, cost $2000.

*Wand of Curling*: With multiple sticks, the electrical or battery-powered Wand of Curling will provide a bonus to an Acting skill via disguise. ENC of 1, cost of $100.

**Snail mail magic communications** 

by Fred

This magical device can be constructed out of many different types of boxes that vary in size or shape with the single requirement that they all have a slot in them that is big enough for a single envelope/package to pass through. In action this item will allow a player to send another player a wide array of missives or small packages containing anything you desire. However this method of communication is extremely slow compared to email (see other references in players handbook) but can contain physical objects. Snail mail has a mind of its own and there is a table of results each time you mail something. roll percentile dice and consult the following table:

1-5% Your mail never arrives. it has gone into another dimension and will require arduous quest to potentially locate it
6-20% Your mail arrives, just at the wrong location. Roll percentile again where anything above 10% results in the receiver keeping your mail forever.
21-95% your mail gets to it intended recipient. Roll percentile again to determine condition. Results above 50% and the mail is unharmed. Otherwise divide by 10 and the mail takes that many points of damage rounded down.
96-100% A monstrous creature called the mail-man is summoned who attacks after issuing one of the following the statements “your postage is "insufficient!”, “mishandling mail is a federal offense!”, “overseas letters must be sent via air-mail!" . He is a wild fiend dressed in very short pantaloons wearing a distinctive looking circular hat that is enchanted to protect him from sleet, snow and provides enhanced night vision. He is always armed with a wand of magic missile.

**The Door-to-Door Wandering Monster**

by Fred

This terrible wandering monster will attack you at your home base, camp or even a temporary stopping place if you stand somewhere too long. There are a number of different variations of this beast but the effects are similar. Once approached you must make a save vs intelligence or be ensnarled for 1-12 turns. You make continue to make saves every turn with the of adding an additional temporary +1 cumulatively to your intelligence every turn until you finally save or 12 turns have passed. Varieties include a selection of religious zealots. This variety usually walks or peddles up to you wearing a completely covering jacket and pantaloons (often black) no matter how hot the temperature outside. They can also be wearing what appears to be a black, flat noose tied around their necks. They always travel in groups of at least 2 and will spend the time while you are ensnarled trying to
convert you to their religion. This can include pamphlets that contain information that defies logic or reason.

Another version is salesman. This variety will attempt to pressure you during your ensnarlment to purchase expensive items you don’t need that will frequently not work. Even if you agree to purchase the items they are pushing they will continue to tell you how wonderful the items are and what a great purchase you have made until you save or the time runs out. roll percentile dice to determine what they are selling. 1-10% a magic item that is supposed to clean your home, den, castle, dungeon but usually just breaks during the first use. 11-40% A variety of potions that when applied to your face/hair/body will increase your comliness by +3. This is a usually harmless product but it will do nothing thats promised at all. 41-70% Miraculous food products that you can sell to your friends so they can sell to their friends. This will end up costing you all your accumulated wealth and you will end up with a vault full of food and drink that will taste horrible and provide no more nourishment than eating tree bark. all the while your charisma will drop -6 points and your friends will avoid you and flee on seeing you coming. 71-100% candy. This inisdious product is usually sold by what appears to be children. During your ensnarlement they will tell you tales of woe that will make you feel bad if you don’t give them all your loot. Save versus wisdom or give them whatever coinage you have on you. Also, the candy has an addictive quality, especially the peanut butter patties, that will cause you to seek out further Door-to-Door monsters looking for the children who sell the cookies.

**Marie, a Rug of Mothering**

INT 11 (+0), WIS 18 (+4), CHA 10 (+1), I+2 S+3 F+3 J+2 (Protector)

Appearing as a fine blue and red threaded Belgian worsted wool rug, with some rather nice patterning, Marie forms a very strong emotional attachment towards the owner, in fact, an overwhelming attachment of motherly love. This involves whispering suggestions that they should brush their teeth, comb their hair, eat their vegetables, polish their shoes, and make sure that they have clean underwear before going outside. Any and all potential romantic partners will be treated with disdain with every potential flaw elaborated to their point that further affections down this path will lead to financial calamity and massive social embarrassment. If Marie is constantly ignored they will engage in passive-aggressive attacks with a bonus of +2, but only causing mental damage, rather than the usual mental plus social damage.

As the rug of mothering seems to be a common psychological trope there are regional variants of Marie that can appear as a Persian rug, a shagpile, a hallway runner, tufted, and braided. In one unique variat the rug of mothering even appeared as a doormat, with all that follows. In Japan, a Kyōiku mama takes the form of a tatami and is especially ensuring the educational success of their child. Invariably such a mat ends up in the hand sof a labourer, for narrative reasons.

**Shannon, a Ring of Turning**

INT 13 (+1), WIS 18 (+4), CHA 13 (+1), E+4 S+1 T+1 P+2 (Promoter)

The androgynous Shannon makes the appearance of a plain white gold ring of some obvious value. However, by means of subtle persuasion, as such Things are wont to do, Shannon will passed one character to the next until they find who expresses a hatred towards same-sex attracted individuals. Through a very gradual process Shannon will "turn" the character. As such homophobia is based on the internal will of the charactre's own homosexual desires, this is carried out as a series of mental attacks, until they are brought to zero mental hit points as wounds - however in this case they are not incapacitated, but in the contrary, they are cured of their own irrational hatreds and will truly accept their own desires.

> New Study Links Homophobia with Homosexual Arousal   
WASHINGTON -- Psychoanalytic theory holds that homophobia -- the fear, anxiety, anger, discomfort and aversion that some ostensibly heterosexual people hold for gay individuals -- is the result of repressed homosexual urges that the person is either unaware of or denies. A study appearing in the August 1996 issue of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, published by the American Psychological Association (APA), provides new empirical evidence that is consistent with that theory.

**Simon, a Djinn and Tonic**

INT 13 (+1), WIS 18 (+4), CHA 13 (+1), I+3 N+2 F+4 J+2 (Counsellor)

A bottle of gin from the Levant, made from juniper berries grown near the Sea of Galilee, truly a fruitful bush miracle. Apart from the usual effects of gin, this special bottle also contains a djinn, named Simon. Because the consumption of gin has a low-loathing of self, and a high-loathing of others, Simon makes themself appear as the character's conscience to reduce their loathing of others. Of course, Simon has a conscience of their own, and it is quite possible that the character is quite justified in their loathing of others; in which case Simon will counsel the character in a manner that can resolve any issues. See also al-Jinn under section 3.2, Monsters.

*by Daniel Callahan and Lev Lafayette*

Charles the Tall started their career as an intern in a legal firm. They are fairly competent at their job, and are becoming especially good at strategy and logistics for the firm that we works for. This seems to be a direct result of the inordinate amount of time that they spend at their desk planning mighty sieges against distant fantasy kingdoms; his cow-orkers have no idea why and any attempt in conversation will result in him engaging in his elaborate tales of a magical world.

The reason for Charles' unusual behaviour is that one day he visited the coffee machine, emptied the pot into a massive cup, and accidentially fell down a portal to a fantastic world where he was set upon by a kobold who rather fancied the cut of his jib. Charles was not about to take this from the monster and managed to kill the kobold with his bare hands through a series of comic errors and good fortune on Charles' part. 

After defeating the kobold he met an elderly woman who said that the kobold had been thieving off her for years and Charles began to learn about the strange and fantastic world that he had found himself in, with kobolds and elves and dragons and many other wondrous beasts. Curiously, at least to is perception, he found that they could all speak English - or rather the universe had decided that he could speak 'Common'. 

Then, one day, another portal appeared underneath Charle's feet and he found himself back exactly where he was before, coffee cup still in hand. Since then Charles has had several visits to the fantast world and at each visit there has been no change in time from his previous departure. He has a peculiar situation where he is learning and experiencing at twice the speed of normal people who are trapped in a single universe. 

It is however taking quite a toll on his mind, as Charles is not entirely sure which reality is "real" and which one he should treat as a dream and will done on about how confused he is with endless monotony. On the plus side, he has become quite a competent writer combining the dry logic of being a clerk in the mundane world with the creative imagination of being a fantasy world wizard. 

As he is taken out and taken in to the two realities apparently at random, Charles is a little on-edge in preparation for these sudden changes. There is also the moral quandry he has with informing his now two partners, one on each world, and how he can explain that there'someone else in his life, but they're in another universe, or maybe it's a dream.

Since his initial visit three years in the past, Charles The Tall has become an adviser to the Elf King whose lands are being encroached upon by neighbouring humans. Charles has made use of his engineering and logistic skills to develop seige weapons in the forest against these invaders and as a result has become well-known in the Elven lands.

Charles The Tall serves are an illustrative example of how you can introduce existing *Papers & Paychecks* characters into a *Fantasy Papers & Paychecks* environment.

Chiron is the Centaur of Disease Control and advocate of herd immunity. Educated by Apollo in the fine arts and medicine, and granted intellect and wisdom, Chiron is highly sought for his medical skills, however he will sharply castigate those who have sought medical treatment from "sorcerers" and "magi" - this coming from a talking horse. This said, Chiron is simply the best healer in the ancient heroic world. Although, he does have one particular weakness - wine. As a Centaur, Chiron simply cannot hold his drink and if he has too much (Centaurs drink like horses and it affects them proportionally like humans) he will revert to his "wild side" which can be a little too amourous. Unlike other Centaurs, Chiron is wise enough to be a teetotaller - but is someone was to slip him a drink.

Chiron is married to the nymph Chariclo; they had three daughters and a son. Further elaboration is up to The Boss' imagination.

Suffocate	

Emerson Hunter appears as a simple ceiling mounted fan, however unbeknownst to the visitors to Room 101 of the Love Hotel, Emerson is a killer. Emerson uses his ESP abilities to investigate the mind of whomever is sleeping in the room and, if they are found to be wanting by Emerson's quirky moral standards, he will engage in the slow death of hyperthermia, hypothermia, and asphyxiation. The practical effect of this is that Emerson will engage in one Suffocate attack per strategic turn, that is, two attacks per night. People of Korean ethnicity will receive double damage. The movement rate is for Emerson is, of course, circular. 

Emerson can be placed anyway in a tropical locale where use of a fan is encouraged, but the wet season means that windows are kept closed. PC Workers can be called on to investigate after a number of unexplained deaths and hospitalisations from being sleeping in the room. There will be, of course, no way to connect the fan to the deaths, except for one strange discovery in some ancient records - the first person to die in the room was a Korean War veteran suffering from PTSD whose name was, coincidentall of course, Emerson Hunter.

## 3.2 Fantasy Bestiary

**Al-Jinn**

Often Anglicised at Djinn, Genie and the like these are ancient demon-like creatures of the Middle-East and northern Africa. They are not necessarily evil, but are spirits that have an insubstantial form (usually humanoid but often enough as animals) and the more powerful ones are not exactly adverse to being worshipped, and not adverse to possession if the need or desire arises. Because of their great power Jinni are appropriately feared although powerful sorcerers sometimes seek to bind them to servitude. Naturally enough Jinni do not approve of being bound in such a fashion but will be relentlessly polite in fulfilling their master's wishes and exacting according to their preferred interpretation of the order provided. They are, in many respects, the ultimate deconstructionalists. There is a famous story of a person who rescues an Jinn bound in an item and it grants the rescuer a wish; like many would the rescuer asks for great wealth. A local Sheikh becomes very angry to discover his treasury has been looted.

*Al-Jinni story*. Abu Hasan Zoba'ah is a powerful Jinn king and is associated with Friday which, according to Islamic custom, is supposed to be a day of rest (at least after midday prayers). Being an individual of some piety, this particular Jinn has become very annoyed with people in a particular town going about their business as usual on a day which they believe should be reserved for rest and contemplation. Their plan, in very *Papers & Paychecks* style, is to get their a score of Jinni in town to run amok, upturning trader's carts and so forth. Unfortunately that has created *more* work on this day of rest (c.f. "parable of the broken window") and many of the lesser jinni are quite enjoying causing such problems. Frustrated Abu Hasan Zoba'ah has turned to the PC Adventurers (if through a third party) to get the lesser jinni to behave and have provided special capturing lamps to do (think of the containment units from the film *Ghostbusters* (1984)). Bonus player points to anyone who has the audacity to point out Abu Hasan Zoba'ah that by releasing the jinni to do work on Friday afternoons they were actually contradicting their own principle. 

**Beaver, Giant**

Giant Beavers (Castoroides, Trogontherium) is a Pleistocene-period creature that was native to North America and Eurasia respectively which, for all intents and purposes, has the climatic range and is assumed to have behaviour of contemporary beavers. Apart from the obvious difference of size, the Giant Beaver propotionally shorter hind legs, probably a longer and thinner tail, and had larger teeth, and a smaller brain in proportion to size. With a length of around 2m and a weight of over 100kg, Giant Beavers will build dams, canals, and lodges for their homes. Beaver families typically consist of a single adult male and female and their kits. Whilst beaver pairs mate for life if a beaver's mate dies, the survivor will partner with another one. Both the male and female take part in raising offspring and maintenance of the lodge. 

Apart the obvious uses from their fur and meat, in a fantasy environment one can replicate the medieval belief that Beaver testicles and castor sacs for both pain relief and as a contraception. Aesop's *Fables* describes beavers chewing off their testicles to preserve themselves from hunters. In the great classic Hellenic tradition, nobody actually checked this, because beaver's testicles are inside its body. Nevertheless, it made a good story and was continued in medieval bestiaries. For purposes of fantasy *Papers & Paychecks*, both are true. The Giant Beaver's testicles are internal, but can be 'externalised' by muscular relaxtion if required. Although not very bright, they are smart enough to leave their balls behind if someone is hunting for them.

*A Giant Beaver story*

A local lord has a rather promiscuous and headstrong daughter who is greatly loved by his subjects, in both senses of the term. Because of her popularity, the lord is unable to engage in the usual strategy of simply locking her up to retain her economic value in a potential future marriage and has resigned himself to the fact that his daughter likes to party (perhaps even one of the PCs has had such an encounter). According to the local spell-casters, the best means of ensuring some sense of lineage when she is finally married off to a neighbouring lord's progeny (and thus becomes *their* problem) is to make use of the mighty contraceptive power of Giant Beaver testicles. The problem being, of course, that there are no Giant Beavers nearby, ergo a Quest is required. To make the scenario even more difficult, the Giant Beaver has to be captured, as one pair of Giant Beaver balls will be effective for a limited time (1 week per point of Giant Beaver STR). The PCs may need to transport the entire Giant Beaver family. Needless to say, the Giant Beaver's family is well protected by local Elves who, apart from being nature-loving hippies, also realise its economic value.

**Basilisk and Cockatrice**

The Basilisk as a thoroughly mythological creature, with an early account from Pliny the Elder. Found in Northern Africa, the Basilisk is described as a serpent (later bestiaries gave it legs), "being not more than twelve fingers in length", that is so noxious it destroys shrubs by its breath, and even breaks stones. The venom of the Basilisk is ranged, and even worse still, it can kill with its gaze. A basilisk is born of a serpent's hatched by a rooster (or even a rooster's egg hatched by a serpent) and its evil disposition is possibly due to this unusual parentage. According to legend the crowing of a rooster will kill as basilisk, but this would mean that the young would have a very short lifespan. Appropriately for the comic value of *Papers & Paychecks*, the crowing of a rooster will send a Basilisk into a panic and it will flee whenever it hears one; such is its fear of being scolded by its known parent. The European subspecies of the Basilisk is the Cockatrice. These charming variants also have wings, which just adds to the pain. 

Famously, the only natural enemy of the Basilisk is the weasel. The weasel is capable of rapid movement, dodging the gaze of the Basilisk, and is also immune the Basilisk's venom. Unfortunately for the Basilisk, it is not immune to the urine of the weasel, which acts as both antidote to the Basilisk venom and also as a poison to the Basilisk; "so true is it that it has pleased Nature that there should be nothing without its antidote".

For various reasons the Basilisk is a solitary creature. Regrettably, they are also intelligent and could theoretically gain levels in fantasy professions. There are known stories of Basilisks being capable of speech and one can only imagine the circumstances that lead to such a being acquiring such skill.

In combat a Basilisk attacks with its Sense (sight) skill, with the gaze causing death (NO SAVING THROW) with an effective range of 25m. The gaze can be reflected back on the Basilisk. The venom of a Basilisk attacks with a STR 15 against the target, using the Basilisk's Missile skill and DEX as a characteristic bonus with a base range of 3m. The peck of a Basilisk also delivers venom. 

*A Basilisk story*

A Basilisk named Anguis has spent many years at the familiar of a wizard and has learned some skills in magic, as well as a degree of moral reasoning. Unfortunately the wizard has died and Anguis has become lonely, in a very un-Basilisk manner. Anguis craves human (or dwarven, or elven, or even halfling) company again, despite the fact that most people who prefer to destroy him. Further, Anguis wants to know exactly what sort of serpent and what sort of rooster is required to make more of his kin, as he has dreams of raising a family of good Basilisk. This could be hard for Anguis as he is still a venomous serpent with a death-gaze and if startled he may accidently look in the wrong direction. Will the brave PCs adopt Anguis and assist him on his dream? What could possibly go wrong?

**Bonnacon**

Classic and medieval bestiaries refer to the Bonnacon as coming from south-eastern Europe into Asia minor, and perhaps beyond. Very similar to other bovine breeds in terms of size and general appearance, the Bonnacon has inward-facing horns (rather like a ram) and a horse-like mane. Whilst the Bonnacon can butt with its head, or even trample, its preferred attack mechanism is to release dung which can "covers a distance of as much as three furlongs", according to Pliny, and which is incredibly acidic, "scorches pursuers like a sort of fire"

In most other respects the Bonnacon is like other members of the *bovinae* subfamily; a large quadrupedal ungulate mammals with cloven hooves, with a lifespan of around 20-25 years, living as a herd animal with collective behaviour with bulls on the circumference of the herd's range protecting the cows and calves. The gestation period for a cow is about nine months long. Unlike most *bovinae* the Bonnacon is not domesticated by humans, for some fairly obvious reasons.

When attacking with its "Missile" the Bonnacon uses its PER as a characteristic bonus, rather the DEX. The weapon does x2 acidic damage after armour with a base range of 200m, and will burn armour reduing it at a rate of 1 point of damage to the armour points per 10 points caused.

*A Bonnacon story*

A local warlord offers a small fortune to the PCs to round up a herd of bonnacon and train them for a cavalry-artillery force, which for some reason he wants called "Tachanka". The task is indeed worth a small fortune, for the herd is almost impossible to catch. The bonnacon occupy a flat grassland with a medium-sized central lake in a field littered with the burnt and grizzled remains of other people, and part of a wolf-pack, who have attempted to capture them. The herd consists of some thirty cows and bulls and fifteen young of various ages.

If by some good fortune the PC Adventurer'succeed in rounding up the herd, the warload gives them another offer. To train and command the Tachanka cavalry-artillery force. From such humble beginnings, a mighty campaign begins.

**Bugbear**

Related to *goblins*, and *hobgoblins* (c.f.,) the Bugbear is a larger member of the kin and is often so large and hirsuite to be described as bear-like. They are a creature of European mythology and are rather partial in lurking in woods near human (dwarf, elf, halfling etc) habitations, where they have opportunities to prey on the sweet meat of children, being their favourite food. After a peasant family has lost their third child to the local bugbear one can understand where the etymology of said beings being a "pet peeve" comes from. Their solitary and ambush hunting style matches their social organisation. Bugbears tend only to associate with their immediate family and often then the relationship is strained due to an innately gruff and bullying disposition. Their disposition, size, and skill does however make them highly sought after by goblins and hobgoblins for particular missions, however the bugbears will insist that they take a lead tactical role in such situations.

*A Bugbear story*

Gerald fancies himself a well-educated Bugbear. He isn't, not that really matters given his attitude. Following a rather devastating regional war, a local Cleric has set up a school at the edge of a local town to cater for the growing orphan population. The fact that it was a religious war has not gone unnoticed by some of the brighter students. Gerald has taken up stalking residence nearby and has taken to leaving behind notes to the Cleric. These notes, apart from describing the taste of the most recent child victim, consist of annoying misspellings and malformed phrases - such as the confusion between "their", "there", and "they're", references to an "escape goat", eating "cold slaw", and being "curled up in the feeble position". The Cleric, who is desperate to teach the youngster the correct use of the language of the realm has had enough and has called in the PCs to deal with Gerald. 

Typically Bugbears eat children. Gerald is no different in that regard. However, once ensconced in his well-trapped lair, he fires off a few quick questions, such as a math problem using order of operations, the capital of Assyria, the airspeed velocity of a laden swallow etc. If the answers of the are satisfactory, Gerald will take the clever child to a classroom oubliette where they will have the opportunity to educate *him*. Otherwise, it off to the cooking pot (Gerald does provide his teachers a delicious sweet pork stew). To make matters more annoying some of the children have grown quite fond of Gerald and his efforts to become educated (Stockholm Syndrome) and will resist any attempt to harm him, or even be rescued.

**Centaur** (*Equus-Homo centaurus*)

The centaur is a mythic half-human half-horse being described as being found in the ancient Hellenic and Roman world, across Asia minor and even to the borders of India. Considered to be wild and eschewing civiliztion, Centaurs also were known for a rather strong libido, but also with their human nature showing great sensitivity to the musical and healing arts. Notoriously, Centaurs are most prone to their worst behaviour when drunk, which is unfortunate because they quite enjoy getting drunk. 

As with horses, centaurs are foraging herbivore herd animals preferring open plains.

*A Centuar story*

It's time for the Olympus in the big city! The centaurs are present with their team, but their champion athlete the long-distance runner, Incitatus, has been kidnapped. Not only are PC workers are employed by the Centaurs to find out what has happened to their famous galloper, they are also given a very generous sum of gold solidi to purchase several barrels of wine for a victory celebration after Incitatus gallops to victory. There is the slight problem however that the city authority has expressely forbidden the sale of wine to centaurs on account of their atrocious behaviour when inebriated. How did the centaurs get the wine? With some appropriate investigation the PC Adventurers will discover that Agents and Coaches of the home team have arranged the provision of wine to the centaurs via the Thieves' Guild. The centaurs, being centaurs, had a couple of drinks on the sly, and the champion runner soon became incapacitated and has been dragged away into a Guild's holding cell (underground of course, you know what it's like for a centaur to climb a ladder?). This curious scenario allows for fantasy and sporting professions!

**Chimera**

The Chimera is a mythological creature initially described as coming from Asia minor and originally a singular being, although that is a lot less fun in a fantasy setting. Accoridng to Homer it has "a thing of immortal make, not human, lion-fronted and snake behind, a goat in the middle, and snorting out the breath of the terrible flame of bright fire", and using some versions here, it is the goat's head that breathes fire. The original chimera was apparently from Mount Chimaera in contemporary Turkey which appropriately has permanent gas vents and fire. This serves well with theme that some high-powered sorcerer has the notion in their head in building a large number of such beasts. 

The Chimera is highly adaptable to mountains and plains. An omnivore, it is as sure-footed as the goat, it has the strength of the lion, and the ambush strikes of the serpent. Fortunately when it comes to social organisation the snake dominates and it is typically found alone. As an asexual and created creature is does not mate. A chimera has a lifespan of around 15 years, reaching maturity at 3 years. There is, however, one major disadvantage that the Chimera has that PC Adventurers may be able to take advantage of; the three heads are of independent mind and sometimes can be quite contrary to each other with problematic results. Typically the lion head operates as an ego, boldly directing the beast as a whole, the goat head as a superego sagaciously advising on what others are thinking, and the serpent as the chimera's id, espressing matters of self-interest.

*A Chimera story*

A particular variety of cannibis grows on top of a rugged hill that can cure the Caliph's young son of a the mental affliction of pica, where they eat pretty much anything but especially those things which have no nutritional content (e.g., clay). The PC Adventurers are charged with the task of recovering a sufficient quantity of the special herb. The unfortunate journey involves dealing with a band of fanatical assassins at the foot of the hill who are under the control of the Chimera, who is rather fond of its special stash. The Chimera, Nouapó Pétra, whilst a deadly opponent, has become quite philosophical due to its consumption of its favourite herb, and will offer a riddle game to each PC Adventurer for access to the plant - and if the PCs lose, it will eat them (of course). The riddles are those of a typical stoner, for example:

"If the universe is constantly expanding, what's it expanding into?"
"Is the S or C silent in scent?"
"If there's an exception to every rule, is there an exception to that rule? What is it?"
"If a mirror's reflection reverses right and left, why doesn't it reverse up and down?"

Any satisfactory answer (and the Chimera is hard to satisfy; a mental successful attack will be required, "mind blowm"). Obviously, the Chimera speaks with a sixties hippie drawl.

**Daemon**

Daemons are part of the mythology of the ancient world; Greece, Egypt, Mesoptamia, and the Levant. In this form they are usually considered intermediary spirits that can inspire or advise mortals through possession. They are not full personalities but rather a mode of activity. One is possessed by a Muse, but that provides a creative energy, rather than the possession of a ghost (q.v.). Most famously Socrates was possessed by a daemon that demanded that he use his conscience! That of course led to all sorts of trouble. In *Fantasy Papers & Paychecks* daemons can exist for any variety of obessive behaviours that may be less than helpful, but rarely directly malevolent as such. Daemons are often formed from heroic personalities; whether or not the daemons possessed the hero or are a residual of their life is a matter for the priests to determine. 

As they are spiritual creatures Daemons have no STR or DEX characteristics. Their movement is based on their full INT value. Their low WIS is a reflection of their single-mindedness, and the low CHA a lack of communicative reason. When attacking to possess a Daemon will use its INT to engage in a series of mental attacks causing bruises; if a character is reduced to 0 bruises the demon will possess the character, and they will gradually heal with the daemon within them. The daemon will typically continue ensure subject's mental bruises are kept at a level to retain functionality, but not high enough to break free of the daemon's control.

*A Daemon story*. 

Nearly all people talk to themselves, from the rhetorical "where did I put my pants?" after a drunken night, to the 3am outward manifestation of one's inner conversation of the meaning of life (which may lead to the aforementioned comment the following morning). Some consider it a sign of great intelligence if there is no-one else to talk to. Modern science notes that replaying or rehearsing conversations is a early warning signs of potential schizophrenia. However the daemon of outward honesty is different to these versions. This daemons forces the character (roleplay it!) to express their judgemental thoughts about others aloud even, and especially, when they are present, e.g., "My goodness, that hat she's wearing is look's like a magpie's nest", "Does this bore ever shut up?", or "I'd love to get into your pants". As you can imagine having such a daemon could be awkward, but at worst those who know the character will never be in doubt of any possibilty of underhand dealing.  For examples of how such a daemon could play out see *The Whole Truth*, an episode of 'The Twilight Zone', or in a more contemporary form, the film *Liar Liar* starring Jim Carrey. 

**Demon**

Deriving from the malevolent form of *daemons* (q.v.) the demons of traditional Christianity and Islam (but less so in Judiasm) retain the possession capabilities of the traditional daemon but with the added bonus of having complete personalities in addition to their general maleficence. Powerful beings they are often under control of a Devil or, occassionally, a mortal who has summoned them and bound them to do their bidding. Demons are not as smart as Devils are will usually fulfill an agreement.

The early modern (c1570) book *Ars Goetia*, from the *Clavicula Salomonis Regis* or Lesser Key of Solomon, has an interesting list of some seventy-two demons divided into Kings, Dukes, Marquises, Presidents, Princes, and Counts. It from this registry that the SPI game "Demons" and the list in the fantasy FRPG *DragonQuest* (1980), at least in the first and second editions.

Demons in *Fantasy Papers & Paychecks* may possess a character whilst in a non-material form. They may transition between material and non-material forms in the course of a round. They will have a variety of attack and defense forms based on their level and form, which is quite unique, and which the aforementioned sources may assist. Rules for summoning and binding a demon are given under the Wizard character class. The statistics given are for a "general" servitor demon, rather than one of rank.

*A Demon story*. 

Renove, "The Beautiful Earl", has been summoned by a merchant-wizard who has tired of what they perceive as onerous taxes on ports and shipping and has sent the demon to the kingdom's treasurer, who just so happens to be a high ranking cleric. Rightly recognising the cleric's intrest in such matters, the demon has taken the form of a very beautiful young man with a melodious voice that echoes wonderfully throughout the gothic arches of the local cathedral. The cleric has become quite obsessed with establishing a stronger acquaintance with this young man, who spoken voice is equally enticing and whose wise words bring hope and inspiration. The treasurer has become quite derelict in his duties, and tax bills are piling up. The PC Adventurers are hired to find out what has gone wrong. *Morte a Venezia* (1971) is recommended prior viewing for The Boss.

**Devil**

> I went out one spring morning  
To find myself a friend  
Someone I could believe in   
Until the very end  
I found myself the Devil  
He was sitting in a bar  
He bought me fifteen Rum and Cokes  
And then he went too far  
-- *The Jazz Butcher*, "The Devil is My Friend"

Broadly speaking, a Devil is a bodily representation of various cultural and temporal expressions of evil, and thus has varied forms and names. The ancient Egyptian religion has Apep, the giant serpent of chaos, the Zoroastrians had Angra Mainyu, the Buddhists Mara. In the Abrahamic religions Satan or Iblis is considered to be the Devil, although sometimes other gods are referred to as devils as well (e.g., Beelzebub is originally the name of a Philistine god, Lucifer originally a Babylonian king). In *Fantasy Papers & Paychecks* a devil is the ultimate ruler of the demons as far as they can be ruled within their feudal hierarchy. At any one time there is only "the Devil", but there is always a number of former holders of the title and invariably they would like to have a shot at the top title again. 

The Devil is a shapeshifter of course and can take the form of pretty much any creature in this book or the core rules. However in their preferred form they appear human (indeed in Tengrism, the shamanic religion of Central Asia, the Devil *is* the first human), albeit with a number of additional features to give themselves that supernatural aesthetic such as great height, goat legs, horns, firey red or black skin, a halo of flames, giant bat wings, and so forth.

*A Devil story*. 

The perpetual Faustian bargain! If you haven't played *kill puppies for satan* (2001) get yourself a copy of the perfect theme. The Devil will grant PC Adventurer's the supernatural and magical powers that they need. However he requires people to lose their faith; so go kill someone's favourite pet in a gruesome manner and they'll soon be thinking that God doesn't care. However, Satan's a smart guy and will just give the PC Adventurer's a less than enough to achieve what they need. So, like a strung-out junkie, they have to come crawling back to Satan begging for more power and an ever-demanding wish list of souls. After all, the Devil is just the tempter and someone who doesn't *quite* tell the truth. The PC Adventurers are the one's who've killed somebody's puppy.

**Dragon**

The Dragon is a mythological serpentine creature of various forms appearing in Hellenic, European, Indian, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese etc cultures, both as land and sea creatures. The European dragons are often winged and capable of breathing fire, and those of Hellenic and Slavic backgrounds often have multiple heads, whilst the dragons of India and eastwards tend to be thinner, and with spectacular intelligence, knowledge, and magic. 

European dragons are basement-dwellers that have a propensity to hoard valuables. They are, in fact, advocates of a metallic-based currency, especially the gold standard. They will go on for hours about the evils of fractional reserve banking, the damage to purchasing power, that inflation is robbery against those foolish careful savers of fiat currency and so forth. Woe to any who recommend that currency should depreciate at the same rate as physical capital. Keynesians and their ilk will be attacked on sight. Likewise such dragons are also renowned for their taste of young maidens (the younger the better) and they may even quietly mention that attempts to regulate such tastes are surely an act of Statist violence; "*Technically*, I'm a hebevore", they will explain, wondering why people want to put them to the sword.

In stark contrast the Indo-Asiatic dragons have innate transformation powers (use the *Papers & Paychecks* bestiary) and are powerful magic users, with a particular propensity towards water-based creatures and water-magic and weather control by a matter of preference. Their wealth is measured in terms of knowledge. Those of a wicked disposition are destructive; their "hoard", so to speak, is the fearful compliance of their subjects, whereas others are satisfied with just respect. Many people of such regions believe that dragons are responsible for creating the first kingdoms and the rulers (if not all people) are descended from dragons. Indian dragons in particular are also sometimes multi-headed. The greatest annoyance of India-Asiatic dragons, apart from the capacity to trick everyone into carrying out their agenda, is their propensity to speak inscrutible riddles. Asiatic and winged European dragons that are capable of flight have a move rating equal to the Strength.

*A Dragon story* 

With inspiration from Disney's 1941 film *The Reluctant Dragon*, a comedy of unexpected behaviour can be generated. Members of a remote village near a mountain range approach the PC Adventurers with the handful of coins that the entire village has scraped together pleading that a dragon has moved into the region. So far it has only taken a few sheep, but who can say how long it will before a child is consumed? Based on eye-witnesses the dragon is on the smaller scale of the usual range.

Eventually making their way to the dragon's lair, the PCs Adventurers will discover that Belchy The Dragon is a thoroughly kind creature who gently asphyxiates his captured sheep before consuming them. Opposed to violence as much as possible, Belchy is a very reluctant dragon, and with some negotiation a deal can be struck; he is willing to protect the shepherd's flocks from marauding wolves and find lost members of the flock for the payment of one sheep per week. The problem being is a local, albeit elderly, knight has also arrived at the village, Sir Giles, and Giles has sworn an oath to his King to slay the dragon. 

**Dryad**

Dryads are humanoid nymphs (female nature spirits) tied to a particular tree. Based in Hellenic mythology, they can be found throughout the Greek and Roman world. Cognate beings are in Japanese mythology (Kodama) and the Indian (Salabhanjika), although an important cultural difference is the whilst the Salabhanjika are meant to be chaste, the Dryad, like other Nymphs, is free from the constraints of polis and as a result is exceedingly well-versed in country matters. Human-Dryad children are known; if they are male they will follow the human path, and if female the dryad path. Dryads have the ability to step into a tree and step out of another one up to 20 metres a way, a form of teleportation, however they will never willingly move more than one hundred metres from their "home" tree. When their tree the dryad dies with it, which means that some are very long-lived indeed. In Japanese mythology a Kodama's tree bleeds if cut which is a nice aesthetic touch that can be ported to the rest of *Fantasy Papers & Paychecks*.

Different types of dryads are tied to different species of tree, whose traits are associated with their personality, thus Daphnaie (laurel), Epimelides (fruit trees), Hamadryad (oak), Meliai (ash), Oreiades (pine), Shalabhanjika (asoka), Kodama (pagoda) etc.

*A Dryad story*. 

"Every Dryad gets a tree, but did I really have to be a baobab?". This is the tale of Alexandria, a tree nymph who was brought into being by Alexander The Great's Empire in Egypt, where a single plant transported by a merchant was the subject of revered curiosity and eventually worship. Thus fed by human worship the nymph formed and now is part of a Hellenic temple complex. It is hardly the greatest situation because there is very few other trees in the city and, being a baobab tree, Alexandria is a rather grotesque-looking dryad. Still, she does her best playing the part of a wise, if strange, woman, who offer cryptic prophecies which turn out to be true in hindsight, which is a good way to retain a business. A problem has arisen however that the temple authorities, who know little of her true nature, have decided that real-estate prices in Alexandria (the port) are too good to ignored and that the tree has to go. Alexandria (the Dryad) needs help, and the PC Adventurers are just the sort who could buy the land if only they could encouraged to steal sufficient funds from another source.

**Dwarf**

The Dwarf is a sapient being of Germanic legend, which gives it a moderate scope across most of Scandinavia, the British Isles, central Europe and parts of eastern Europe. A humanoid folk, they live in various mountain locales (not many Belgian dwarfs), where they show enormous acumen at mining and smithing, and are especially well-known for creating crafting magical items to the point that a cloak of invisibility is almost standard in Dwarfen society. Physically considered somewhat unattractive by human standards, dwarfs are short and muscular. There is a notable gender disparity among Dwards with less than a third of population being female, and culturally they are the hearth-keepers, loremasters and bureaucrats. As a result they are rarely seen outside of Dwarfen society. Dwarfs have a half-normal movement on account of their height, relative to STR, but also half STR for the purpose of calculating Stealth characteristic bonuses.

*A Dwarf story* 

As a continuing trope, the Dwarfs of the Iron Balls Hills "dug too deep", because they are greedy, and "unleashed ancient evil", which for all intents and purposes is an Ifreet (c.f.). A general call for help is released as this murder-fire demon is wrecking having through the Kingdom of the Iron Balls and, brave as they are, none can stand against this ancient evil. Except for the PC Adventurers of course, which must include an duty-bound Dwarf who will go out of their way to rescue the Kingdom. The scenario itself doesn't sound particularly comical, but interacting with Dwarfs should be - they fit every possible stereoptype you could imagine. Financially thrifty yet desiring great wealth, industrious, organised, heavy (but cheap) drinkers, with an interesting taste in food (see some of the edge cases of Icelandic cuisine for examples), the experience of doing any sort of business with a society of Dwarfes will leave most PC Adventurers flabbergasted. Dwarves are *alien*.

**Elemental**

Elementals are fundamental forces of nature made animate, which varies according to culture. Starting from the Hellenic world and expanding into Europe, the Middle-East and northen Africa, the elements are rather like phase states; Earth, Water, Wind, and Fire. In Jainism of India there are also beings that consist of only one substance (*kaya*) however they also the addition of the Plant element. One fairly common mistake is that the Chinese "elements" (wu xing) a representative of this type. Wu Xing is more about movement rather than being and as a result there are no corresponding elementals. Nevertheless, it is from this system of movement that *Fantasy Papers & Paychecks* derives a dominance and overcoming interaction; the Hellenic Water elemental will cause 3* (yes, triple) damage after armour to Fire, which will likewise do the same to Air, which will do the same to Earth, which will do the same to Water. If the Plant element is added, then it is Fire that does tripe damage to Plant, and Plant which does the same to Air. Don'think about it too much, it's doesn't make too much sense. 

Elementals have physical form, often in a general humanoid shape, which also means that they are subject to physical destruction. They can move through their native element at normal speed (the sudden appearance of a burrowing Earth elemental is always an interesting encounter). The physical form of each does provide some advantages. The Wind elemental obviously has the ability to fly but also does so at double rate ("fly like the wind"), the Earth elemental has double the listed STR (but same size and volume) for the purposes of physical hit points, clobbering and lifting things etc. Fire elementals have the advantage of optionally setting combustible items on fire (STR 5 for dry wood, paper etc, 10 for logs, 20 for leather, 40 for iron etc). Water elementals, unlike others, are able to modify their shape and thus are almost impossible to contain. If Plant elementals are used they have the ability to Heal wounds (or bruises) on touch, equal to twice the points that they destructively transfer from their own STR. Note that this healing ability includes all types of damage, physical, social, or mental. 

Elementals have personality types that correlate with their type. Earth elementals are melancholic and sombre, Water elementals are phlegmatic and sagacious, Air elementals are sanguine and socialable, and Fire elementals are choleric and ambitious. Interestingly, Plant elements have no dominant personality except the concept of personal growth.

*An Elemental story*

A wizard hires the party in search for us much pure element as they can find. This in itself is not unusual, wizards are often hiring adventurers do this. When the party is successful, they can go off any do other things - until one day almost a year later they will receive another request from the wizard's *former* apprentice - the wizard entrapped the elementals in various magics and subjected them to a breeding program to create elementals. The elementals now want rescuing from the eugenicist wizard, and also there is new elemental babies to save. A mud elemental, a steam elemental etc.

**Elf**

Elfs are sapient beings originating in Germanic folklore, but also by proximal contact through Celtic, Slavic, Romance, and Hellenic language regions. They are otherwordly beings but also creatures of the woodland, kinfolk of Dryads, magical, and seemingly invisible, and whilst unaging, often lacking in developed moral cognition. Elves, at least of the European variety, tend to want to protect the forests first, enjoy themselves, and worry about humanity a very distant third. Interestingly in the Malay archipelago there is an associated population, the Orang bunian. In both Euopean and Malay mythology, time passes differently in the parallel Elfen realm to human society - weeks can pass in the human world whilst years pass in the Elven world.

Unlike many other Fantasy RPGs, *Fantasy Papers & Paychecks* represents Elfs are thoroughly unpleasant beings, at least from a human experience. As beings are "everyoung" (they stop aging in late adolescence) and with an unlimited lifespan their rulers tends to be extremely powerful, extremely haughty, extremely knowledgeable, and have little consideration for the lives of what they consider to be lesser beings ("they're going to die soon enough anyway"). The subjects of Elven rule tend to be utterly dangerous pranksters whose primary consideration is aesthetic distraction. If a mortal suffers grevious harm as a result that is just too bad. Of course, they are absolutely saddened if one their own kin is maimed or killed, spending months moping about the event. Elfs are amoral narcissists; you don't want anything to do with them.

*An Elf story* 

If there's one thing that Elfs are known for it's for switching babies. That's *hilarious*, right? Well, this time they've gone a step too far, and have switched the child of a local lord and lady, who was able to determine the switch thanks to a scrying device of the court wizard. So the PC adventurers have to go to Elfland, a place of weird terrors - only to find out that they aren't responsible for the switch. Who did it then? A theatrical troupe *playing* Elfs fake pointy ears and all. Why on earth would they do such a dastardly and treasonous act? Possessed by the Muse they will claim (possessed by a bottle, more like it). But they actually do mean this - a daemon did possess them (via a bottle) which led them astray. The demon drink! Hopefully, all's well that end's well, as the leader of the troupe, in a thoroughly theatrical manner, throws the bottle into a well, to illustrate their embarrassment and commitment to ending a drunken scourge. The demon of course, still present in the last few drops of the drink cannot believe it's luck, as it homeopathically spreads itself out...

**Gargoyles**

Gargoyles, grotesque carvings of various real and fantastic beasts, have been used in architecture in Europe for over 1500 years as a protruding gutter, and prior to that in ancient Greece and Egypt. The medieval gargoyle, or so the story goes, was a fire-breathing draconic-like beast that was defeated by a bishop with a crucifix (of course). The tried to burn the remains, but the head would not burn because it had been tempered by the fire-breathing. So they stuck it on the city walls to ward off evil spirits and to spook anyone who thought the city would be easy to take. Fast-forward to the 20th century, and Clark Ashton Smith has a magnificent story (*Maker of Gargoyles*, 1932) where the unconscious thoughts of a medieval stonemason are infused into his creations. Now that's pure *Papers & Paychecks*! Summary version: Gargoyles are animated grotesque monsters that mix it up with unanimated sculptures.

Due to their stony body Gargoyles take a mere 1/4 damage from physical attacks and cause 2x damage with their club-like fists. They delight on dropping masonry on opponents as well. Also, true to the story, Gargoyles will actively protect an area "against evil spirits" i.e., monsters in the *Papers & Paychecks* vernacular. A gargoyles, if it encounters other monsters (anything other than gargoyles), will engage in successive psychic attacks to drive them away. If only they were good at psychic attacks. Gargoyles are also incurably shy and prefer not be recognised as any different to their animated brethren.

*A Gargoyle story*. Perhaps the worst thing for a gargoyle is getting its throat clogged up, and that's exactly what has happened to Gargle the Gargoyle. Gargle, being a typical gargoyle, doesn't want any direct contact with people but still wants to have its throat cleared. So it's come to the idea of stealing items and leaving a trail of evidence that leads to its gullet. The more expensive the better. The PC adventurers are brought to the sprawling gothic church to find out what has happened to their expensive relics which will lead to many incidents of honey-pots, hide-and-seek, and climbing snow-covered medieval spires in the middle of the night. What could possibly go wrong?

**Ghost**

Ghosts are the ethereal remains of a sapient being who, due to a curse or sheer obsessive stubborness, find that they can't quite leave the prime material plane. Most of the time they are entirely insubstantial (STR 0), but taking a Mental Bruise per round they can become substantial, whereby they raise themselves to the giddying heights of STR 1. Typically they do this to rattle a chain, touch someone on the shoulder, moaning, and other such nonsense spooky activities before letting themselves turn insubstantial again. If struck in such a form they will also turn insubstantial again. Note that a Ghost retains whatever level and professions that they had in a past life. Rather than STR ghosts use the DEX to determine movement.

*A Ghost story*. Everyone can become obsessive, and for the appropriately-named Ernest White, a wizard of sorts (he did wear all-white robes with a pointy hood). His increasingly paranoid concern was that too many Orcs were moving into the village. He would spend his days writing contacting local authorities about such incursions, spreading rumours and so forth. Certain that the orcs were planning some bizarre cult-ritual, Ernest decided to protect himself with various magical booby-traps. Sadly he fell victim to his one of his own traps. Now he haunts the abode trying to either promote his paranoid theories of impending Orc apocalypse or trying to drive any Orcs away. PC Adventurers can come to his dilapidated and rambling gothic mansion in search of treasure, but one is warned that the place is still trapped and a hostile Ernest will seek to protect his turf. As a delicious twist, one of the treasures is a family memoir which describes how Ernest is actually 1/8th Orc. If this is revealed to him, the bigoted ghost will sigh and vanish from the Earth.

**Ghoul**

Ghouls, originate from Arabic folklore and in a fantasy Earth enviroment can be found throughout northern Africa, from Asia minor to Afghanistan, and the Arabian peninsula. The masculine word is ghul and the feminine ghulah. They are not undead, as commonly portrayed, but rather a magic-using culture of families that inhabit graveyards where they live on the flesh of the recent dead, or lure people to be eaten and robbed. Ghouls have the ability to shape-shift into hyenas, wolves, or other dogs (use *Papers & Paychecks* bestiary) and particularly skilled ghouls (that is, ghouls with wizard levels) also take on the form of their victim and continue the cycle of deception, cannibalism, and theft. In their natural form, ghouls are unattractive and smell of death, which they seek to cover up.

*A Ghoul story*. 

When your life is living with an small family whose behavour consists of eating the dead, robbing people, killing them, and eating people, you typically don't get invited to many social occassions. But in everyone's life there is a time when romance strike, as so it has to Persefoni The Ghoul. In such circumstances, what's a poor ghoul to do? Spying upon a particularly handsome male PC Adventurer (change as you see fit) at a recent funeral, Persefoni had decided that he is the one that needs to brought home and become part of the family. Using the splendit clothes of the wealthy that have been buried, Persefoni begins her tragic quest for what is *probably* going to be unrequited love.

**Giant**

Giants, in various sizes, are found pretty much across all world mythologies. In *Papers & Paychecks* we've kept giants within an acceptable range from the maximum normal human size to about twice that figure. Please be aware that some mythologies have giants that are well exceeding these values, with the Jain wheel of time including a period where people were approximately 10km and lived for 20,000 quintillion years. It is up to the Boss to decide if and when such beings are included in their game.

Giants, of the European variety, are generally considered strong, lumbering, and not exactly quick of mind, "FBG" ("effin' big giant) is no exception to this norm. However, unlike his decidely more surly kin who like to eat people, and especially children. Unlikely the vague related story by Roald Dahl, in this giant story FBG needs some smaller people to help him catch "a sense of humour" in the dream-land of emotional states. Unsurprisingly, the PC adventurers are tasked with this, and have the tricky job of finding the "sense of humour" spirit among all the other various emotional states, including the unpleasant ones. Two characters that are necessary to include in this story are a human-sized couple, one of whom insists is a giant dwarf, and the other a dwarf giant (a hat-tip to Greg Stafford's *Pendragon*).

**Goblin, Imp, Hobgoblin**

Goblins are small humanoids of an unattractive appearance, especially of the perceptual senses (oversized nose and eyes, large pointed ears) which are found across European medieval stories, and often have a number of magical abilities (levels in the Wizard profession is not unknown). Dominant personalty traits include an earthy mischievousness ranging to the point of delight in malicious harm, along with various levels of greed for wealthy high-value objects. In addition to the European goblin there are similar creatures in American mythology, the Indian sub-continent, China, Korea, and Japan. Whilst goblins are typically a nuissance in comparison to the mighty human (etc) socities due to their innately chaotic disposition (c.f., low Wisdom score) there are a few who manage to organise goblins into something resembling a kingdom. Among the most famous of these is Jareth, King of the Goblins and Master of the Labyrinth. 

Note that there is a subspecies of goblins which are particularly tall and strong, the hobgoblin, who have a Strength value of 3-18 and a bonus range of -4 to +4, but with a reduced Dexterity and Perception (also 3-18). Hobgolins often bully goblins into menial tasks, but goblins often return the favour through wicked pranks. Further, there is a _smaller_ subspecies of goblin, the imp, which as a Strength value of 1-6, but a Wisdom of 3-18.

*A Goblin story*

_`You came back... to a place like this? Why? A man like you? Why?"_

Inevitably PC adventurers find themselves in a situation where they are tasked with "dealing with" goblins, with the solution typically being some combination of fire and sword. This may be in the form of protecting a village from the ravages of goblin bandits (_Magnificent Seven_/_Seven Samurai_ opportunities!) or engaging in what contemporary military experts call "forward defense" (i.e., invading somebody else). In such a situation pick on the most soft-hearted character (or player) and have a clearly defeated goblin plea for their life and make all the promises in the world to be their life-servant etc. If accepted (and this jape only works once), the goblins intentions are indeed true. However, whilst the intellect might be willing, their spirit is weak - very week indeed and where ever the PC goes, the goblin follows in invariably gets into trouble, whether it is stealing small items of value, exposing themselves to noblewomen, etc. Attempts to reform the recalcitrant will be met with ardent promises by the little chap and failure afterwards. For example, if the goblin is taught not to steal a situation can be contrived where the goblin must steal to get the PCs out of a situation. 

**Golem**

A golem is a humanoid, fashioned from raw clay, and through the use of an Enchantment ritual (see Wizard 1.1.2, Perks 1.4) can be made mobile as an automaton, with Strength, Dexterity, and Perception. In ancient and medieval times this particular enchantment ritual was seemingly passed down through a rabbinical line. A golem has no intelligence, no charisma, no ability to think or to speak. It has no profession, and does not acquire skills. It can however, follow instructions and the complexity of the instructions depend very much on the complexity and skill of the "programmer" who writes the program. A Boss may wish to encourage PC adventurers to write the code, and if they really want to get deeply involved they can do so in the Hebrew alphabet (the golem is fed by instructions being fed into its mouth like a punch card). As those in the IT profession know all too well, code = bugs and the more complex one's code the more bugs it will have.

| Perception	    |  3-12     |  -4 to +4	| Wounds (Physical) |   |

A golem has two levels of damage reduction (that is, any and all damage is quartered)

*A Golem story*

Goethe's _The Sorcerer's Apprentice_ is perhaps the most well-known of the golem-mishap stories, and the Disney rendition in _Fantasia_ does justice to the theme, and is a comic-enough example. One particular side of effect of treating golems as automatons in *Papers & Paychecks* is a golem does not stop carrying out its duties even when the enchanter that created and programmed the golem is gone. In fact, stopping a golem and reprogramming it is extremely difficult. Not only is the problem of accessing the machine (pulling the instructions of a golem's body through the mouth, whilst it is in motion), random attempts to do this will result in unpredictable and buggy behaviour. In this particular case, a patron will approach high-level PC adventurers with a very difficult task - there is an ever-growing army of golems, as the wizard got into their mind to create a golem that creates golems. The wizard, Yen Sid, unfortunately had a mishap before their plans for world domination came to fruition and the golems have been following the same instructions. Over time, the PCs will discover the following high-level programming: (1) Fashion golem out of clay (2) Copy program (3) Insert program into golem (4) If attacked, save state, defend and remove cause of opposition, return to state. 

**Gorgon**

Ranging from the west India and throughout the Hellenised world, the Gorgon is a Naga-like being, with a serpentine body, wings (at half normal movement), a human torso, hairs of venomous snakes, and a dreadful direct gaze that can turn the recipient to stone. The victim must look directly into the eyes of the Gorgon for this effect to occur; one can look at the rear of a Gorgon, or look at it indirectly (e.g., via a mirror). Note that any direct gaze into the eyes of a Gorgon (even when dead) will result in petrification. 

The most famous Gorgon in mythology is that of Medusa, who has two sisters of similar characteristics and disposition. Fortunately rare, the Gorgon is not exactly known for a rapid breeding cycle either. The most famous Gorgon was Medusa.

In combat a Gorgon attacks with its Sense (sight) skill, with the gaze causing petrification (NO SAVING THROW) and with an effective range of 25m, and contested against the Wisdom of the target if they are merely "averting their eyes" or some other poor excuse. The venom of a Gorgon's snakes attacks with a STR 15 against the target, using a net attack bonus of +5 (+4 DEX, +1) an a range of 1m. The attack has reduced penetration, but if there is any successful damage the character will be afflicted by a poison that does 3x damage over a ten minute period. A gorgon has 12 snakes on their skull, with three snakes capable of attacking a target per round, and with each snake capable of three poisonous bites a day.

*A Gorgon story* 

When spring comes, one turns to love. In this story, the initially anonymous patron for the PC Adventurers is none other than Little Hannah, who is getting on years and hears her biological clock ticking quite loudly. Little Hannah doesn't get invited to many parties, and as such she hires the PCs to find her a husband fitting of her noble status (or at least she thinks so). Of course there is a whole range of fiendish difficulties with Little Hannah, namely her gaze, her snakes, and the like. Finding a blind herpetophile with a natural immunity to snake poison ought to be challenging of course.  For what it is worth, Little Hannah fancies herself a Wizard (well, a witch) and it is true she has a few levels in that profession. She has, however, a few more levels in Rogue.

**Griffin**

The griffin is a creature of legend from ancient Egypt, the Hellenic and Roman worlds, medieval Europe, and Persia. The griffin has the head and forequarters of an eagle, giving it excellent perception, and the handquarters of a lion, providing excellent strength. The griffin also can fly, making it quite formidable. As intelligent creatures griffins are invariably of the ENTJ personality types, dedicated to the abstract protect of what is morally right, rather than getting their claws dirty in directly combatting the evil of the world, with the single exceptions of slander and libel, which offends the griffins sense of purity through truth. Griffins have mountain aeries which are connected to shallows burrows they have dug out; in the burrows they lay their golden eggs. Despite claims to be highly moral creatures, griffins are quite perverse; some breed with horses, resulting in the ill-temperered and malicious hippogriff, from the Hellenic world, which lacks the ability to lay golden eggs and is jealous and greedy as a result. There is a few curious examples from Assyria, where griffin mother - human father crossbreeds have occured, resulting in a lamassu, human torso on a lion's body. They often are in the role of protectors of human treasures.

A griffin's melee attack is either front eagle's bite (x2 damage) front claws (x2 damage) or rear claws (3x damage). A typical attack is to grapple with the front claws then rake with the rear the following action. A griffin can also dive-bomb, receiving a charge bonus to their Strength (c.f., 1.3 Skill Options and Elaborations). A griffin's feather and hide body protects for 2 points of damage.

*A Griffin story*

Harry and Hermoine, perhaps not a very well-educated griffins, built their aerie on a mountain on a fault line. This afforded some magnificent view views over the coastline, and provided some wonderful burrows for which they can lay their golden eggs. Unfortunately there was an earthquake in the night, which led to both Harry and Hermoine breaking their wings, and their golden eggs tumbled down the burrows. They are now earth-bound, and the mountain has taken such a beating that there are entrances to the burrow complex from the ground level. Harry and Hermoine will be patrons to the PC Adventurers to help find the golden eggs in the mountain complex (which, of course, will be filled with malevolent monsters), fashion a proper entrance, and build a portal to protect the egg-burrows. Yes, Harry and Hermoine require ...  a griffin door. 

But wait, there's more. One of the issues that Harry and Hermoine Griffin have is that there is a Wyrm that lives nearby, named Lucius. Given that there is now a cave entrance open, he could just *slither in*. Also, following the earthquake an ancient chamber that contains much wisdom can be found, but it is behind a very old door with an interesting locl. It can only be opened by one with great strength who can maneuver the weights correctly; it's a dumbbell door.

**Harpy and Siren**

Harpies beckon from Roman-Hellenic mythology and are found in that world and are usually found in small groups. They are a half-human, half-bird, and almost always female (male harpies are jealously guarded by the brood). Derived from the vulture, a harpies claws are quite impressive. Harpies are ravenously hungry.

There is significant debate among observers whether harpies are ugly or beautiful, with a split among the scholars. In reality they are both, some appearing with a crone-like visage and a dreadful squawking whereas others with stunning youthful beauty and melodic voice. If one likes, the former can be described as *harpies* and the latter as *sirens*. Magically, there also seems to be a difference as the former associated with air magics and the latter with the sea, for those who have magic-using professions.

Because of this divergence, the CHA value of a harpy uses an *inverse* bell-curve. Roll 3d6; if the result is 10 or less, add 8, and if it is 11 or more, subract 8.

*A Harpy story*

In the late Middle Ages the Hellenic isle of Milos became part of the Duchy of the Archipelago. In this story, the local lord of Milos is Yianno, a young man prone to all manner of fashions, and very interested in being very wealthy. The obsidian glass of which Milos is famous for is determined as his path to riches, as it can be fashioned into rather beautiful jewellery. Yianno's problem, for which the PC Adventurers are hired, is that a brood of harpies prevents the miners from quarrying and ideal quantity of the volcanic glass and as a result, his path to wealth is nowhere need as rapid as it could be. Whilst the PC Adventurers are tasked with the job of removing the harpy threat, it is soon discovered the villagers and even the miners are paying the harpies (with offerings of food, wine, oil etc) to create the threat, simply because their Lord is so thoroughly disliked on both their personality and their ideas. The harpies are all to willing to play along.

**Homunculus**

Found primarily in mythological writings the early European modern age, but also to a lesser degree as variants in Islamic world and Hellenic texts, the homunculus is an example of "preformationism", the suggestion that organisms come from miniature versions of themselves. This became an alchemical theory with the homunculus with the suggestion that miniature people could be created through the proper experiments on "precious bodily fluids". A homunculus is, essentially, a rat-sized person, and many are trained in the magical arts.

*A Homunculus story*

Homunculi are usually kept as solitary creatures, at least in part to the difficulty of their creation. However, Count Johann Ferdinand von Kufstein and Abbé Geloni, an Italian cleric, reputedly made several of them. A problem comes up when the homunculi start talking to each other and learn about their shared interests. The homunculi are, however, dependent on the count and the priest, but would much rather live independently. They act as a patron to the PC adventurers, firstly, escape - the PCs must look like the homunculi have been stolen, although they are located in several disparate locations. Secondly, find a home for them. Apart from the homes of their masters, the homunculi have no knowledge of the outside world. Finally, and more difficult, the homunculi would like some *female* homunculi in their life. Being made from men, all the homunculi are also male. A wizard who can create femal homunculi needs to found; curiously, there is a character named Gargamel who might be able to help.

**Ifreet**

Like their Jinni kinfolk, Ifreet appear in Middle-Eastern and North African legend. There are several major characteristics about them which put them in a category of their own. Firstly, they are a death spirit, which means that they a drawn to a life-force, and especially to locales of a murder victim. They are fire spirits, which means that they're often found underground or in certain regions (e.g., volcanoes, deserts), known for heat and fire. They are also shapeshifters and are able to take the appearance and form of a humanoid. All this would suggest that they are a wicked species and indeed most of them are with a few exceptions. They can be banished by the correct prayers by the faithful, of which there are truly very few people indeed.

*An Ifreet story*. Almashay is an extremely unusual ifreet insofar the he wishes not only to help people, but he wants to be firefighter. His career in this direction started when he was attracted to a massive fire caused by a landlord who wished to claim insurance and was pretty indifferent in who was inhabiting the buildings at the time. Horrified by this lack of compunction, Almashay sword to put out fires whenever he could. However his own firey nature often gets the better of him and he more often *causes* fires in his attempts. The PC Adventurers are hired to find out why their are so many fires in the old town and Almashay is tasked with given them a tour, with potentially hilarious and tragic results. See episodes of the 1960s children's television series Grisù for example misadventures of Almashay.

**Kobold, Boggart, Brownie, Tonttu**

Kobolds are creatures from Germanic mythology who inhabit the same environs as common humans; either peasant homes, mines, or shipping, which they take on physical characteristics appropriate to their profession. They are called Boggarts in England, Brùnaidh (Brownies) in Scotland, and Nisse in Norse lands, or Tonttu in Finnish lands. They are related to Goblins.

Roughly the size of children Kobolds remain unseen to human sight in daylight hours when they rest, but in the night they will come out and perform various chores, according the profession of the humans that they live with. Whilst an industrious worker, the Kobold will expect generous compensation in food and clothing and if insulted they will become quite a difficult house spirit. If a household, ship's crew, or mine workers become sufficiently well off, kobolds will depart to find a household in greater need. The most famous kobold story is "Die Wichtelmänner" from Brother's Grimm, translated as "The Elves and the Shoemaker"

*A Kobold story*

Bob and his fellow boggarts live in a workshop in the village of Mugsborough called "The Cave" by those who work there. It's a building-trades workshop, with carpenters, plumbers, plasterers, bricklayers, painters etc, working from dawn to dusk each day. Unlike other Kobold communities, Bob has issued a rule that the Kobolds will not interfere with their work - for Bob can see that their labours are not entirely their own, but rather great wealth is taken by the workshop owners, Lord Rushton. Instead, Bob directs the Kobolds to keep account on who is, and isn't present - and someone is missing they visit their house to do chores, as these industrious workers would have to be ill not to come to work.

What the Kobolds could not expect is that Lord Rushton would close down The Cave. Enough buildings had been made for the petty nobles of the region and the workers would have to go work on the land as tenant farmers, despite the fact that they had no skills in farming. There is obviously many houses in Mugsborough that need repairs, and there are people who can do the work; but Lord Rushton is not interested. Bob is desperate; he sends Kobolds out to find good-hearted men of wealth who can perhaps put the men of The Cave into gainful employment again. That is when a boggart named Owen finds the PC Adventurers. But Owen has a different idea, he thinks that the cause of the problem is Lord Rushton. Given that the commoners won't rid themselves of this lord, perhaps he can convince the PC adventurers to do instead.

A Quasit story

**Qilin**

A chimera-like creature primarily from Chinese mythology and other East Asian cultures (e.g., Kirin in Japan. Girin in Korea, Gillen in Thai, Ky-lan in Vietnam), the qilin is a magical creature with horns, mane, cloven hooves, and a scaled body. As intelligent and astoudingly good creatures, they are vegetarian, sagacious, and of sound judgement. Despite an overwhelming preference for peaceful activities, they can defend themselves by spouting flaming breath, and often have a magical profession.

*A Qilin story*

There is no good without some evil, and no evil without some good, at least that's what some sages say. In this case, a qilin with a positive reputation comes with a secret sin; it's not quite vegetarian as it would like to be and is wih a dash of vindictiveness, it greatly desires to feast upon the flesh of Mogwai (q.v.). It has located such a demon in the castle of a local warlord, and provides directions on how to get there. It obviously can't do itself, as it's too big to enter the Mogwai's chambers. Alas for the PC Adventurers, the Mogwai in question turns out to be an innocent little child, barely a toddler. However, it also turns out that it _is_ a Mogwai. Just don't give it water after dark.

A Unicorn story

**Vampire**

Whilst the term itself (originally vampyre) is relatively recent, dating from the eighteenth century, the *concept* of blood-sucking demons in human form that are shapeshifters seems to have a cultural resonance across Europe, Africa, Asia, and even to a lesser extent the Americas. There is a multitude of reasons that the dead rise as a vampires as are the solutions for preventing or destroying a vampire. Courtesy of *Vampire: The Masquerade* (1991), the roleplaying game, a dominant contemporary meme is the concept that vampires are *sired* by an existing vampire draining the blood of a mortal, setting up a generational hierarchy. This seems to a fairly good concept that is acceptable to other mythologies so it's worth keeping in *Papers & Paychecks*, not being at all adverse to copying good ideas from anywhere. Sincere imitation really is flattery.

As undead creatures Vampires do not need to breathe and sleep, although they do need to eat, although their diet is restricted to the species-specific blood that they once were (usually human). Vampires can be killed by a stake (wooden, iron, whatever) through the chest which destroys the heart, or decapitation. Apart from these methods and those which completely destroy the body in entirety, vampires regenerate pretty much any sort of wound [EDIT]. 

Vampires tend to come from the wealthy members of society, partially due to their heretical lifestyle and partially because they have access to ready supply of poor people at hand whose disappearance can number in the scores before suspicions are raised. The other advantage of being wealthy is that Vampires can make a killing (haha) on long-term investments. Some political theorists have recognised this: "Capital is dead labour, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks" (Karl Marx, Capital, Volume One)

*A Vampire story*. 

**Zombie**

The classic Zombi is a magically reanimated corpse from Haiti, the word first recorded in the 19th century, however it has become a very popular staple in science fiction with radiation, viruses, etc as being the source of zombification. There is good evidence that the Haitan zombie has its origins in central, west, and south African legend. Others locate expressions of zombification from Mesopotamia where there is threats of the dead rising to eat the living in the Descent of Ishtar and the Epic of Gilgamesh. As for Lazarus being raised from the dead...

Whilst *Fantasy Papers & Paychecks* encourages the most widespread use of zombies, because they are so much fun, there are some thematic considerations to include. Zombies should be strong, not too quick, and not too bright. They're a bit stiff having been dead for a while, and the brain is quite sluggish too. But they have a dead weight about them and can pack a hell of a punch. Whilst they don't have to breathe or sleep, they do need to eat and lacking in any sort of social mores, they don't mind eating people. They will follow, to the best of their ability, the orders given to them by their creator, and if their creator comes to an unfortunate end they'll try to continue whatever the last order was. If they don't have any orders they'll wander around aimlessley and occasionally eat someone.

*A Zombie story*. Isn't the worst sort of Zombie the cute little lost girl who an opportune moment rips your throat out? With famous appearances in *Night of the Living Dead* (1968) and annoyingly typical in the South African variant of the Zombie myth, this little Ishtar delights in the taste of human flesh, but it is very patient and will appear as a confused waif in dire need of rescuing from some terrible tragedy (often enough she's the actual cause of the tragedy). Naturally enough she likes to fight on her own terms and will direct the PC Adventurers into an environment where their weapons are next to useless and she can make best use of her size, such as the oubliette or latrines of old castle. Think of her as Newt but with the cunning of one of the hunting aliens.

**The Pizza Computer** 

by Shaun Hately

From actual experience. Proof positive that some things are *for* us, even if they have a twisted sense of humour.

"Hi, I ordered a pizza online yesterday for delivery at 9.30 last night. It never arrived. My order number is xxxxxxxxxxxx."
"One moment.... your order is scheduled for delivery at 9.30 this evening."
"Yeah. No. I ordered it for delivery for 9.30 last night."
"It's down for delivery this evening."
"I have the e-mail confirming the order in front of me. It says delivery at 9.30pm on 4/1/2018. That was yesterday."
"Let me open it up and have a look... you're right. My apologies. I don't know what happened. This is all automated."
"That's fine. But I'd like a refund."
"You don't just want the delivery this evening?"
"No."
(Bear in mind that I am fasting today which is why I was rather annoyed at my dinner not arriving last night. The food arriving at 9.30 this evening would be taunting me because I would not be allowed to eat it for another 10 or so hours, and I would have been without food for about 30 hours at the time of delivery.)
"All right... Um... it won't let me process a refund because there hasn't actually been a delivery yet, so the computer says there is nothing to refund. Are you sure you don't just want the delivery this evening?"
"No."
"OK... let me try and cancel the order.... it won't let me cancel the order, because it's already been accepted and it's in the queue. You know it really would be a lot easier if you just accepted the delivery this evening."
"No. That's not acceptable to me."
"Yeah, OK... Sorry. I understand. The computer doesn't understand though... let me try this... no... no.... no... sorry... no..."
"Look - I was probably going to order another pizza tomorrow night... can we transfer tonights order to then? Would that be easier?"
"Yes. Yes. Is that OK?"
"Yes, but I'd like a 7.30 delivery."
"No problem... OK.... done. Delivery for 7.30pm 6/1/2018 - you should receive an e-mail confirmation in a moment."
"Great."
"Oh..."
"What?"
"OK, now we have an order for 7.30 tomorrow night. And an order for 9.30 tonight."
"Am I paying for both orders?"
"I don'think so. But if I really understood how this software worked, I probably could have cancelled the order. OK - let me just check... OK. I've cancelled payment on tomorrow's order. And I'm comping it... OK... your pizza tomorrow will be free, so, even if they deliver tonight's pizza, you're only paying for one pizza."
"I really don't want tonight's pizza delivered. I cannot eat it. I want to be in bed before 9.30..."
"Ah... I could change the delivery time until earlier."
"You can change the delivery time? OK... change it until 7.30. I guess I'll stick it in the fridge or something."
"Done... oh... now we have an order at 7.30 tonight. An order at 9.30 tonight. And an order at 7.30 tomorrow night... OK - I can at least cancel... no, that's the order you want. That's the only one I cancel... would you mind if I got my supervisor?"
"I think I'd really appreciate it if you got your supervisor."
"Hello... yes... I can see what is happening. But the computer isn't letting us do anything about it... OK - do you want tomorrow night's order?"
"Yes."
(By this point, I am craving pizza... yes, I want pizza tomorrow if I couldn't have it yesterday and I can't eat it today.)
"OK... I can issue a refund on your first order later this evening after it's been delivered at 9.30. The 7.30 order tonight and the 7.30 order tomorrow night are both complimentary. And I'll make a note that your next order is also complimentary... I think that's the best we can do."
"So I am getting four free pizzas? Two of which I don't want."
"Yes... sorry... I know this is a bit ridiculous."
"Yeah... don't worry. I know this isn't your fault. And I appreciate you both trying to fix it. And it's a pretty cool story."
"OK... enjoy your pizzas. Well, some of them anyway."

**The Telstra Switch**

by Marg Lewis

This is another example from actual experiences referring to a person to try to change their home phone plan, but thwarted by a prankster computer that has other ideas.

Me: I’d like to change my home phone plan.
Telstra: Certainly Plan A will provide xyz.
Me: Sounds great, sign me up.
Telstra: What is your address?
Me: Strathlea Rd, Strathlea, 3364.
Telstra: Please hold while I set this up.

25 minutes later...

Telstra:Thank you for waiting. We are unable to provide a home phone to that address.
Me: I am calling from my Telstra home phone at this address.
Telstra: Please hold while I try again.

25 minutes later...

Telstra: Thank you for waiting, we definitely can’t provide a home phone service to that address.
Me: Well I am calling from my Telstra home phone at this address.
Telstra: How long have you had the service?
Me: My grandparents had the phone connected to this address in 1926, my grandmother operated the local telephone exchange from this address until 1968, then we switched over to an automatic exchange 5 km down the road, so my family has had a phone at this address for 92 years.
Telstra: Oh, there must be a problem our end, I’ll get it fixed and call you back. Do you have a mobile number?

# 4.0 Even More Boss and Alternate Settings

## 4.1 So You Want it Darker?

### 4.1.1 Papers & Paychecks in North Korea

Nearly all games of *Papers & Paychecks* are run with a high degree of tongue-in-cheek humour. There is however, a certain body of gamers who prefer their grim characters to face up to the horrors of the world. These are the sort who like to play *Paranoia*, for example, in 'straight' mode, or delight in their *Call of Cthulhu* investigators being driven mad by eldritch horrors from beyond the stars. Recognising that such people exist led us to explore the possibility - what is the most strange, totalitarian, authoritarian, and bureaucratic regime that exists on earth today? Whilst some places may have the dubious honour of winning a single metric among these dimensions, for purposes of consistency across the board, the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea is the winner. As a very unusual change of pace from the standard *Papers & Paychecks* game, 'So, You Want it Darker?' provides a researched account (including anonymous first-hand reports) from a setting that is nevertheless worthy of in-game exploration.

### 4.1.2 Geography

A description of the geography is hopefully a safe and non-controversial starting point. As a country, it is located in the northern half of the Korean peninsula, sharing a land border to the North with the People's Republic of China along the Amnok River, a short border along the Tumen River with Russia in the far north-east, and with the Republic of Korea (South Korea) in the south along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The length of the meandering land border with China is just over 1400km, the border with Russia is less than 20km, and that with South Korea is almost 240km.

To the west is the Yellow Sea and the northern extension, the Korean Bay, which connects to China. To the east is the Sea of Japan. The Yellow Sea and the Korea Bay are off the west coast and the Sea of Japan (known in North Korea as the East Sea of Korea) is off the east coast. There is over 3500 islands off the coast of North Korea, mostly along the western coastlines. The most significant collection is the Pansong Archipelago, which includes the largest island, Sinmi Island, which has an area fo some 50 square kilometres.

Over eighty percent of the country's area is mountainous, but the north and eastern part of North Korea are extremely so with the Hamgyong Range (north-east), Kaema Plateau (north, east), Kangnam (north, central, borders with China) Rangrim Mountains (north, east), T’aebaek Mountains (east to the South Korean border and beyond). The landscape ranges from several hundred metres to the country's highest point, the volcanic Baekdu Mountain, at over 2700m on the border with China.

Coastal plains on the east coast are minimal. On the west however, there is the substantial Pyongyang and Chaeryong plains. The north and eastern mountain ranges act as the source for the major rivers of North Korea which mostly run in a westerly direction. The longest is the Amnok River which runs for almost eight hundred kilometres forming the border with China, where it is known as the Yalu River. The second longest river, the Duman, is unusual insofar eastwards into the Sea of Japan. Although over 520km, it is almost entire unnavigable due to the moutainous terrain. The third longest, at c440km, is the Taedong River who flows NE-SW and runs through the country's capital, Pyongyang.

The climate is temperature and humid continental (Dwb) on the Köppen climate classification scheme in the far north-west third, whereas the rest of the country is classified warm and humid continental (Dwa). There are four distinct seasons, with warm summers and cold and dry winters. A short rainy season in summer is known as chagma, which is short, hot, and humid. The winters are notoriously cold, especially in the moutainous north and east regions. In winter the temperature range in the capital is typically from -3 to -13 degrees C., and in summer from 20 to 29.

Forest covers around 50% of the country, and has decreased substantially in recent decades due to various forms of land-clearing. Approximately 20% of the land is arable, with about 2-3% being used permanently for cropland and pasture. There is significant dispute over the prevalence of wildlife, with some considering the conditions dire, and others claiming a good amount especially in comparison to neighbouring parts of China and South Korea. Recorded mammals include various species of squirrel and chipmunk (e.g., Siberian chipmunk), mice and rats (e.g., Tanezumi rat), pika (e.g., northern pika) and rabbits (e.g., Korean hare, Manchurian hare), hedgehogs, shrews, bats, cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises), carivores (e.g., Eurasian lynx, Korean fox, Eurasian brown bears), and ungulates (e.g., Manchurian sika deer).

### 4.1.3 History and Politics

For much of its history Korea has been politically and culturally unified. It is true that over 2000 years ago the Gojoseon kingdom ruled the northern half of the peninsula, speaking a proto-Korean language known as Ye-Maek, whilst the south was controlled by a confederation of small states known as Jin. Growing out of the northern region was the Kingdom of Goruryeo whose name is cognate with 'Korea', and which lasted for several hundred years. At its height it controlled all of the northern and central part of the peninsula and parts of contemporary China and Russia, along with much of the south. As contemporaries in the far south there was the small Gaya confederacy, which nevertheless lasted some five hundred years, existing between larger Silla kingdom in the south-east and the Baekje kingdom in the south-west and western coastline. Silla absorbed Gaya in 562 CE, and then conquered Baekje in 660CE, despite the military support that Baekje received from Japan. Several years late Silla, with an alliance with the Chinese Tang dynasty, was able to conquer the Goguryeo kingdom as it was it was struggling with a succession conflict. Silla (often referred to Unified Silla) then controlled almost the entire peninsula for some 250 years until 935CE, with the exception of the northern regions of the contempory North Korea, which was under the control of the multi-ethnic Manchurian Balhae kingdom.

In the tenth century CE, a disaffected Silla general formed a short Later Baekje (aka Hubaekje) kingdom in the south-west. At around the same time, a new Goguryeo (aka Hugoguryeo or Taebong) was established in the north and central region. The latter eventually took over Hubaekje (930) and Silla (935), establishing a unified kingdom (or empire) throughout the penisula. This would last for over three hundred years (until 1392). The Hugoguryeo Empire defeated the Liao Empire on multiple occassions leading to the development of a cultural golden age in the 11th century CE with developments in scholarship and printing. Mongol invasions in the 13th century pressed the Hugoguryeo and brought much hardship to the land; eventually they sued for peace to the Great Yuan as a client state. As the Mongol Empire disintegrated and the Ming dynasty emerged the Goryeo court was split between those who supported the Ming and those who supported the Yuan. 

General Yi, who supported the Ming, overthrew the Goryeo dynasty and established the Kingdom of Great Joseon which lasted almost five hundred years, from 1392CE to 1897CE and made Confucianism the state religion. The Joseon period was enormously influential on contemporary Korean culture, establishing norms, language, etc The development of the Hangul alphabetic-syllabic script in the 15th century CE in the court of Sejong the Great could have transformed technological and scientific development, but it was opposed by the literary elite who preferred classical Chinese. In the late fifteenth century CE and sixteenth century CE, there was a series of factional conflicts known as the Korean literati purges, or 'sahwa' between two factions of the ruling scholarship class. In the late sixteenth century CE, with European weapons, the Japanese invaded but were eventually expelled following naval victories (with "turtle ships") and intervention by the Ming Chinese. In the seventeenth century the Manchurians engaged in two invasions forcing Joseon to become a tributary state of the Qing dynasty until 1894. 

In 1894 there was the Donghak Peasant Revolution which resulted in scores, if not hundreds, of thousands of peasants killed by the government and supported by the Qing dynasty. This intervention by the Qing was a breach of the Convention of Tientsin, and led to the Sino-Japanese war, which was decisively won by the Japanese who forced the end of Joseon's vassalage, leading to the short-lived Korean Empire. This lasted less than thirteen years before it was annexed by Japan following their victory in the 1905 Russo-Japanese War. Imperial Japanese rule remained in place until their defeat in 1945 when the country was divided between Soviet and American occupying forces along the 38th parallel (the latitude, almost comically, chosen by two US officers who used a map from *National Geographic* and wanted the capital, Seoul, to be on the U.S. side). The history of North Korea thus begins with the establishment of the Soviet Civil Authority in October 1945 and the Provisional People's Committee for North Korea in February 1946 with Kim Il-sung, anti-Japanese guerrilla leader, as chair. The Provisional government instituted land reform reduced landlord's claims to the same as other civilians and major industries were nationalised. Whilst achieved without apparent bloodshed, some 400,000 fled to South Korea as refugees. 

With the Republic of Korea declared in the south and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea declared in the north, with both having military leaders, and both claiming to the legitimate government of the peninsula, war was inevitable. Three years later, with over four million deaths (mostly civilians) an armistice and the establishment of a UN-enforced demilitarised zone has ensured an uneasy peace since. The destruction of North Korea was massive, with almost every substantial building destroyed. Nevertheless North Korea recovered rapidly and by 1957 industrial production had recovered to pre-war levels, assisted by Chinese and Soviet aid. An attempt by the pro-Chinese (and Soviet supported) Yan'an faction to remove Kim Il-sung from leadership failed and political opponents to were subject to show trials, imprisonment, and execution. The industrial economy grew with the provision of (often unreliable) electricity to all homes by 1968, primary and secondary education, and a high level of urbanisation. All during this time there was low-level conflicts with the Republic of Korea; two notable incidents include the failed assasination of South Korea's president, Park Chung-hee, and the capture of the U.S. spy-ship, Pueblo. 

During his rule Kim Il-sung developed a cult of personality exceeding that of Stalin, on which it was modelled, and rejected both the Soviet and Chinese models of Marxist state socialism, both of whom reduced their military, financial, and ideological support for the regime. Increasingly developing its own method and ideology, Juche, usually translated as "self-reliance", includes political independence, economic self-reliance, and an independent military. The precursor to Juche was the 'Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System' which are a set of (unsurprisingly) ten principles and sixty-five clauses for governance and behavioural guides for the people of North Korea. They were riginally proposed by Kim Yong-ju, the younger brother of Kim Il-sung, in 1967 and made official by the son of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il in 1974. 

In 1982 these ideas where expressed in an authoritative form as "On the Juche Idea", written by Kim Jong-il. As a explicit depature from Marxist philosophy when concentrates on class conflict as the dynamic of history, Juche sees the primary conflict as human effort against nature, espouses an idealist rather than materialist ontology, and argues that it represents a new era of human thought. From 1997 onwards the official dating system counts Juche years from the year of Kim Il-sung's birth in 1912. Thus 2017 is "Juche 106". One notable effect of the adoption of "self-reliance" is that North Korea's GDP per capita, which had been equal and often slightly higher than that of the South until the mid-1970s, is estimated to be 4.5% of that of the South ($1800 USD vs $39400 USD), as the latter has traded its way to economic prosperity and has given up military rule in favour of democracy.

Kim Il-sung died in 1994 and was replaced by his son Kim Jong-il as General Secretary of the governing Korean Workers' Party and chair of the National Defense Commission (NDC). Kim Jong-il'seventeen year rule was particularly notable for a major economic crisis and famine in the 1990s, caused by declining foreign aid, loss of trade partners, lack of critical capital equipment, and flooding. The famine, known as The Ardous March, resulted in several hundred thousand deaths by conservative estimates. Politically, in 1998 the Supreme People's Assembly wrote the president's post out of the constitution and designated Kim Il-sung as the country's "Eternal President". Already recognised as the leader in Juche thought, Kim Jong-il further developed the idea of an independent military to the policy of "Songun", or "army first" in 1998, notably becoming a nuclear weapons power in 2006. The Songun policy was further developmed in the 2000s with the argument that the army represented the leading force of society, which some political historians have observed is another departure from Marxist orthodoxy which argues that this role belongs to the workers (or, in China's case. the peasants). As a historic achievement, of sorts, North Korea's military expenditure reached over 20% of the country's GDP under Kim Jong-il, the highest proportion in the world (the world average is 2.25%). 

> "We cannot live without you! Our country cannot exist without you!"   
> No Motherland Without You (aka, "Ode to Kim Jong-il"), popular North Korean song frequently broadcast on the radio and from loudspeakers on the streets of Pyongyang   

As a minor, but successful, departure from Juche thought a special industrial zone, the Kaesong Industrial Region, was established in 2002 with trade links to China and South Korea. This dovetailed with the "Sunshine Policy" advocated by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung to improve North-South relations and to allow South Korean companies to start projects in the North. The Kaesong Industrial Region however was closed in 2016 folllowing rising military tensions. Another example was the opening of the Mount Kumgang (Diamond Mountain) Tourist Region in 1998 which allowed South Korean and other foreign tourists to visit this part of North Korean territory. However it was closed in 2008 when a South Korean tourist was shot; the North claimed he had entered a military zone. In 2011, after many years of illness, Kim Jong-il died. The regime declared him "Eternal General Secretary" of the WPK and the "Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission", in keeping with the tradition of establishing eternal posts for the dead leaders. This two is a historic achievement of the country, being the world's only necrocracy - officially ruled by the dead, if in name only.

Kim Jong-il was replaced by his younger son Kim Jong-un, who took a usual array of positions heading the political, ideological, and military functions. Kim Jong-il had his uncle Jang Song-thaek executed in 2013, and it is believed that North Korean agents were behind the assassination of the eldest brother of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-nam, in Malayia in 2017. Like his predecessors, Kim Jong-il cultivates a personality cult, with satellite photos revealing in 2012 that a 500m message carved into a hillside in Ryanggang Province, reading, "Long Live General Kim Jong-un, the Shining Sun!". In 2013 a new set of economic measures were introduced which allowed enterprises to engage in a degree of autonomy, wage differentiation by management, improved levels of autonomy and family-harvest collection in the smaller collective farms, expansion of consumer goods, and increased trade with China. A show-case of gleaming modern buildings in 2014 were mockingly dubbed "Pyonghattan" by reporters at the time, expansion of the construction industry continues to this day. Despite some apparent improvements for the urban population, it was estimated by a UN report in 2018 that some 40% of the population, primarily rural, suffer from undernutrition. It is in this context that the future history of North Korea will be written.

### 4.1.4 Culture and Society 

The culture of Korea is described by its language, religion, arts, lifestyle, and norms. differentiated in contemporary times by the division between the Koreas resulting in some unusual, and increasingly unique, cultural expressions in North Korea. Insofar that the shared symbolic (audio and visual) values provide a the representation of cultural values, these are considered first. This section also includes various demographic information about North Korea which provide an adequate description of the everyday life experience of North Koreans.

As a language, Korean and Koreanic language family, is usually considered a contemporary language isolate, with suggestions that it may be part of the proposed Altaic language family is usually rejected, or the proposed Dravido-Korean-Japonic language family to be controversial - although there is simularity in vocabulry and grammar. Playing it safe, many linguistics place Korean in a Paleosiberian language family - a term of convenience to incorporate in a number of language isolates in the region. Within the Koreanic language family in its own right, Modern Korean is the only member with the exception of Jeju, spoken by less than ten thousand people in a island province of the same name south of peninsula. Modern Korean is derived from Middle Korean (from the 10th to 16th century's CE), and in turn from Old Korean (from the 4th to 10th century's CE), with the latter derived from the ancient languages of the peninsula and of southern Manchuria.

Korean is an agglutinative language; affixes are added ("glued") to words to change a word's meaning in a sentence or grammatical position. Sentence endings are also used, to indicate surprise, dispassionate acknowledgement of fact, agreement, rhetorical questions, and voluntary action, to give several common examples. The word order in the Korean language is subject-object-verb e.g., "Chin-Sun japchae eats". The writing style is the aforementioned Chosŏn'gŭl, invented by King Sejong the Great, known in the South as Hangul. The alphabet consists of 40 characters; 19 consonants and 21 vowels. Letters are arranged syllabic blocks and are written left to right (they were traditionally written top to bottom, right to left). An interesting feature of the characters is the correlation between the shape of the letters and the and a representation of the mouth's position when they are pronounced. There are minor differences in lettering between North and South, and several dialects throughout the peninsula. Another minor difference is foreign-language word borrowings; North Korea has more Russian words, whereas South Korea has more English words. Furthermore a selection of Hanja characters (use of Chinese characters in the Korean language) is also taught in North Korean schools and universities.

North Korea is officially an atheist state where estimates suggest that approximately 2/3rds of the population are non-religious. Among those that do follow a religion (apart from Juche, of course) approximately 1 in 7 follow tradition Korean shaminism, 1 in 7 are part of the Chondoism faith ("Religion of the Heavenly Way"), a neo-Confucion religion established in the early 20th century, approximately 1 in 20 are Buddhists, and there is a small number of Christians. Korean shaminism, also known as Muism or Sinism, incorporates ancestor worship, spirits of various scope and power, holistic considerations, and mediation in rituals of sacrifices, dance, song, and prayers, between the gods, the mu (shaman), and worshippers. The mu are ascetics who seek purity of body and man. Chondoism developed from the Donghak ("Eastern Learning") Confucian movement which opposed the encroachement of Western ideas, and carried the secular ideas of poverty alleviation, especially amont the peasants, and political stability. It is recognised by the North Korean government as being revolutionary, anti-imperialist, and is represented in the government through its own political party. The North Korean constitition does include freedom of religion and even the construction of religious buildings, but all within the caveat of protecting the state from foreign powers and ensuring social order. In effect this means that any religious organisation is, at best, closely monitored.

Religion also plays a role in the traditional crafts of North Korea, incorporating elements of historical shamanistic dance rituals, EDIT

Whilst freedom of the press is technically allowed under the constitution, in reality it is strictly controlled. North Korea regularly rates near the bottom of the international assessments conducted by groups such as Reporters Without Borders. Propaganda is pervasive, and news content is heavily orientated (c95%) towards local issues, albeit including the issue of reunification. Foreign affairs or news is rarely mentioned. There are twelve newspapers and twenty periodicals, with the major newspapers being Rodong Sinmun ('Labour Daily', newspaper of the Central Committee of the Worker's Party of Kora), Joson Inmingun (newspaper of Korean People's Army), Minju Choson ('Democratic Korea', the government newspaper), Rodongja Sinmun ('Workers Newspaper', newspaper of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea), and in English and French editions, 'The Pyongyang Times'.

Radio is the most commonly used broadcast media in North Korea. The four North Korean radio networks, the Korean Central Broadcasting Station, which acts as the main domestic full service radio network, Pyongyang FM Broadcasting Statio, for domestic music, the Pyongyang Broadcasting Station, an "all-Korea" service primarily aimed at South Koreans and ethnic Koreans in China, and Voice of Korea, a multi-lingual shortwave broadcaster aimed at worldwide audiences. It is illegal for North Koreans to listen to anything other than state-run radio and all radios sold by state shops in North Korea are fix-tuned to government frequencies. Notably North Korea does not jam any commercial South Korean television or radio broadcasts, however some of South Korea'state-owned radio and television broadcasts are subject to jamming. Internet access and mobile phone use is highly restricted, usually available to members of the nomenklatura (party elite). From 2013, foreigners visiting North Korea have been able to use mobile phones with local coverage only.

In North Korea there is one official source of television news, Korean Central Television (KCTV), first established in 1953. It currently broadcasts for eight hours a day on a regular schedule of music, news, documentaries, children'shows, sports, drama, feature films, and curiously situation comedies, including a military comedy called 'It's So Funny', which has been running since the 1970s. Between 2004 and 2005 one particular television show is deserving of special prominance, entitled "Let's trim our hair in accordance with the socialist lifestyle". In addition to this news channels there is the educational channel, Mansudae Television which broadcasts for three hours on Saturdays, and nine hours on Sundays. It was temporarily suspended in 2015 for reasons unknown but then revived. The newest station available is Sport Television.


## 4.2 Fantasy Papers & Paychecks

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tabletop_roleplaying.png" />

The opportunities for humour in fantasy is rather impressive, and even more than the opportunities from realistic settings. There is a degree of course that the normal world of *Papers & Paychecks* immediately matches with *Fantasy Papers & Paychecks* with sapient items. In *Fantasy Papers & Paychecks* the hidden aspect of items is no longer necessary. A magical world allows for items to be intelligent, active, and often malicious - but now they argue back ("don't worry, many fighters have swords more intelligent than they are", as a cartoon in *Dragon* magazine once stated). A magic world allows quite openly for bizarre natural effects; talking columns, rivers that flow in the wrong direction, floating rocks and so forth. Adding implausible and contradictory descriptions. For example, the hilarious National Lampoon satire *Bored of the Rings* includes "The Tiny X-shaped Forest" and "The Flat Mountains". Even an entire world can be this effect, and its becomes especially effective when used for real-world cultural referents. For example, Terry Pratchett's *Discworld* is a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle. Adding the right personality traits and objectives to these bizarre effects can provide an additional comic effect.

Character place names provide many opportunities for puns or satire. Greg Costikyan's wargame *Swords & Sorcery* included Logarithm Son of Algorithm and with the locations the Nattily and Evelyn Woods and the Stream of Consciousnes. In the *Bored of the Rings*, there's Dildo Bugger instead of Bilbo Baggins, Moxie and Pepsi instead of Merry and Pippin, Arrowroot, son of Arrowshirt instead of Aragorn, Sorhed of Fordor instead of Sauron of Mordor, son of Arathorn, Gimlet and Legolam instead of Gimli and Legolas, and of course Tim Benzedrine and Hashberry. The simple method being used here is take a well-known fantasy character, make a parody of their name that fits *both* the personality trope and the behaviour. As for an example of how this plays out, who can forget the effects of eating some of the "dubious-looking mushrooms" offered by Tim and Hasberry?

> Tim, now a rather handsome six-foot carrot, laughed loudly and changed into a coiled parking meter. Frito, dizzy as a great wave of oatmeal flowed through his brain, grew heedless of the puddle of drool collecting in his lap. There was a noiseless explosion between his ears and he watched with terror as the room began stretching and pulsating like Silly Putty in heat. Frito's ears began to grow and his arms changed into badminton rackets. The floor developed holes out of which poured fanged peanut brittle. A score of polka-dotted cockroaches danced a buck-and-wing on his stomach. A Swiss cheese waltzed him twice around the room, and his nose fell off. Frito opened his mouth to speak and a flock of flying earthworms escaped. His gall bladder sang an aria and did a little tap dance on his appendix. He began to lose consciousness, but before it ebbed completely, heard a six-foot waffle iron giggle, "If yoo dig it now, jes' wade till th' _rush_ hits you!"   

Fantasy authors, and especially FRPG authors often seem lackadaisical about character names and may even generate some accidential humour. Consider the following from the *Monster Mythology* supplement for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, which on other respects is quite a good book. Here's the introduction to the back cover blurb.

> "Maglubiyet... Blibdoolpoolp... Diinkarazan... Panzuriel... Such names are whispered in the dark on the far side of midnight, or muttered fearfully around jugs of wine when old, scarred adventurers tell their tales."  

It seems far more probable that these are names that are mispronounced in moments of red-faced drunken laughter rather than "muttered fearfully". "And then we confronted Blippoopoop... I mean Bliddlilooploop.. Sorry Blibdoolpoolp, that's what I *really* mean!".

## 4.3 Boss-Level Secrets

In the core rulebook there is an extensive section for advising The Boss on how to keep player-character workers in line whilst at the same time generating an interesting story of action and adventure. Alas, sometimes The Boss finds themselves being berated and bullied into submission by their players whilst at the same time plot outcomes seem to unreasonably favour the PCs. Well, it is time for you to take back control. It is time for you to be The Boss, with the definite article, and start shouting in German because life is short and terrifying. Shout it! Bist du unterm Pantoffel stehen?! See, you feel better already. Now, let's take back control of the game whilst *pretending* that you haven't and creating an entertaining story that players will think is of their own creation. This is *The Secrets of Being The Boss*.

**Maximum Game Joy**

Many suggestion of game play argue for "fun". An example of this is found in *RuneQuest: Roleplaying in Glorantha*. It reads:

```
Maximum Game Fun
When writing, thinking, and gaming in Glorantha, always ask yourself, "Now, in this situation what is the most fun?" and then go with it. That's Maximum Game Fun (MGF). Keep this principle in mind whenever you apply the rules of RuneQuest to any situation.
```

Now one would be thinking that a deliberately comic game like *Papers & Paychecks* would *thoroughly* endorse this comment. At first blush, it does make a lot of sense with objective of entertainment. But there is a couple of minor modifications to the suggestion, whilst giving it recognition as a worthy contribution. Firstly, it is recognised that the word "fun" comes from the North Germanic noun fon ("foolish, simple, silly") or verb fonnen ("make a fool of"), and in English it first appears in 1680s meaning "to cheat, trick". Now sometimes we do want to play a foolish and silly game; "shits and giggles", as it is often described. But not all the time. 

Perhaps what should be sought is "Maximum Game Joy", which is closer to a happiness from acquisition or experience, bliss, and glee. What's the difference? With "joy" you can have a _player_ experience depths of frustration and sadness, at a particular moment and still come out of the experience with _joy_ - just like a good play or movie does. Think of a player who is so moved by the description of a scene that they are literally in _tears_ (of sadness or happiness). This does not sound like fun, but it certainly is joy.

```
Give them pleasure – the same pleasure they have when they wake up from a nightmare.   
-Alfred Hitchcok, On audiences, Asbury Park NJ Press (13 August 1974).   
```

One other point must be emphasized, and why "joy" is probably a better objective than "fun". "Fun" tends to argue for immediate pleasure in a situation which is short-term, whereas "joy" provides greater opportunity for a delayed, but longer-lasting pleasure from the gaming experience. The sheer frustration of battling Whitechapel the Fatberg may not seem to be much fun at the time, but when it is finally defeated and the secret revealed, a greater and more satisfying pleasure is received. "Joy" can and often should include "fun" especially in a game like *Papers & Paychecks* where the humour can contain slapstick elements. But is not always and not just fun; "joy" is a more encompassing term. So think it terms of what is the most _joy_ you can bring to any situation, and go with it.

**Luck: Rarer than Rocking-Horse Shit**

*Papers & Paychecks* is a game that comes with systemic narrativism. That is, the players have a metagame value to alter the result of a die-roll according to their volition, and is rewarded to players who make an earnest contribution to the game. In part this is the systemic implementation of what GMs have been doing for years in a subjective manner. After all there's an entire game-system called "FUDGE" (yes, it is an acronym), which was a bit of an in-joke recognition of this problem. GMs for *years* have looked what the dice have rolled and promptly ignored it because it would completely derail a plot, or never even get into the plot, such as in the case of a failed Library Use roll in *Call of Cthulhu*, or it would lead to the sudden, random, and unexpected demise of a favoured PC or NPC. For the most part, as long as the illusion of randomness is maintained, all seems well.

It is important *not* to fudge the dice results in *Papers & Paychecks* in this fashion for two reasons. The first is the aforementioned element of "narrativist" game design where, in part at least, the player gets to direct the story, and often the fate of the character that they are playing. Sometimes this is done for tactical reasons, for example, to save their Luck points for the "big bad" event, person, or thing, at the end of a project. The other reason to avoid fudging dice rolls in *Papers & Paychecks* is that the need to do so has been largely removed by the introduction of Luck points. Adding dice fudges with Luck can lead to a game which is too easy, and that would be contrary to the spirit of the game which really demands that the players are kept on their toes, as their characters barely make it through by the skin of their teeth. By all means do fudge-modify that "hidden from players" die roll when they are making critical perception checks or the equivalent of the library use roll - but also modify their Luck when doing so. 

Further, players should seriously earn their Luck points. Just an overly-generous GM in other games can make things too easy for the players by fudging the dice in their favour more than what is deserved, the same can occur when a Boss in *Papers & Paychecks* is overly-generous with the awarding of Luck points. Remember that Luck points are awarded for particularly impressive contributions during play. Merely turning up doesn't provide one - but not turning up without a valid excuse will result in a penalty. Roleplaying the character doesn't generate Luck - that's expected behaviour. But acting contrary to how the character would act will result in a penalty. Melodramatic and thoroughly entertaining roleplaying will generate a Luck point. Great opportunities for melodramtic roleplaying occur when the dice come up with their maximum or minimum values.

In many ways, Luck is both a carrot and a stick to encourge players to engage in the story in a dramatic fashion. When the Boss awards points it acts as a carrot. Waving around a shiny glass bead that catches the light at the right moment is a great prop. On the other hand the possibility of the Boss taking away a Luck point acts as a very powerful stick. Remember that this is a game where Luck points can go negative - which means that the Boss will favour the world as antagonist against the player and their characters at the worst possible time. Overall however, there should be sufficient opportunities for players to earn at least a 3-4 Luck points per game session - and certainly at least 4-5 situations where they almost certainly have to spend one to get out of a problem. Review the *Code Of Cthulhu* from the core rulebook to give a particularly strong example of Luck in action. 

Make the players are actively seeking ways to gain Luck points. Encourage them to do so. Get them on their knees begging for a Luck point. Remember that Luck is a *player*  characteristic, not a characteristic. In a story, the most powerful character is often quite different to the one who is most Lucky, and indeed, the sheer pluck of a weaker charater will often see them through, "audentis Fortuna iuvat" (Turnus, in Virgil's "Aeneid"), "fortune favours the bold", and in *Papers & Paychecks* the player has a mechanism to give a higher degree of truth to that statement than reality would otherwise grant. But of course, not just any player. It is those players that have earned Luck points. It is those who have contributed by their acting, by providing a pleasant venue, to those who arrive on time etc. A character who is powerful but is played by a person who is a disruptive person and is constantly out-of-character will find that fortune does not favour any of their characters.

**The Magical Realism of Monsters**

```
Newt: My mommy always said there were no monsters - no real ones - but there are.   
Ripley: Yes, there are, aren'there?   
Newt: Why do they tell little kids that?   
Ripley: Most of the time it's true.   
-- Aliens (1986)
```

Whilst *Papers & Paychecks* is partially inspired by modern rolepaying games which have supernatural elements (the *Ghostbusters* "frightfully cheerful RPG is particularly noted), it is very important that the Boss ensures that the monsters aren't real, at least in a sense. This may seem counter-intuitive at first. After all, the various sapient monsters in the main rulebook have charactreristics, skills, personality and so forth. In that sense, yes, they can are "real". They are NPCs who will have a direct influence on the environment and PCs. 

In another sense however they are not real. That is, all their activities remain hidden from human perception and recording. All the effects of a monster's behaviour is something that is explicible; the coffee machine gurgles and spurts hot fluid over the final contract that you're about to deliver to a meeting, the pen that leaks just as one purchases an expensive white shirt, and so forth from the trivial nuissance to downright dangerous, the things appear to be have a mind of their own ranging from mischief to malice. 

Under almost no circumstances however, will the monsters reveal themselves, and to a degree they probably can't - their perception is called "Extra Sensory Perception" for a reason. They are, in a sense, "spiritual machines" and created from their presence with humans. With the exception of voice-controlled devices, even communication between monsters and humans takes the appearance of "voices in one's head", and we know how people who make such claims are treated. Of course, exceptions do exist (c.f., Garry the Gazebo) but again such a revelation is stories which no person would believe, and those who claim otherwise would be justly ridiculed.

The literary genre to apply, albeit often in a comic manner in *Papers & Paychecks*, is that of 'magical realism'. Whilst it is common among fictional genres for their to be some furious debate about such terms in this context it follows the expression found in writers like Gabriel García Márquez (_One Hundred Years of Solitude_) and Salman Rushdie (_Midnight's Children_). In these novels, from the protagonist's perspective, the world is certainly magical. But the expression of this magic is subtle, and subjective. From an objective viewer, various events may have a dramatic quality about them, but they are certainly realistic. Keep that spirit in *Papers & Paychecks*.

**The Age of Cant**

A great source of inspiring humour for any session of *Papers & Paychecks* is the use and mis-use of language. Some examples of mis-translations have already been provided in section 1.3 Skill Options and Elaborations. A sensitivity to absurdity, the ability to make insightful puns, and the discomfort of satire that borders the truth are all wonderful skills to develop in a game of *Papers & Paychecks*; not only should it be the norm, it ought to be thoroughly encouraged. In addition however, there is the issue of _cant_, which includes argot, jargon, and often the world of hidden meanings. Some examples follow:

| What Academics Say	| What Academics Mean	|
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Various sources	| I forgot the name and author of that paper |
| We are grateful to the two anonymous peer reviewers for their constructive comments| God help them if I ever find out who they are	|

**Mask Falls Off**

Sometimes the 'Monsters' of the world of *Papers & Paychecks* aren't as careful as they should be, and there is a 'glitch in the matrix'. A very famous case occured in 1995, when Robert Matthews of Aston University, England, demonstrated that toast often falls on the buttered side, far beyond the expected laws of randomness (c.f., Matthews, Robert (1995) *Tumbling toast, Murphy's Law and the fundamental constants*, European Journal of Physics, vol.16, no.4, July 18, 1995, p. 172-6.). The author argues that it is the angular momentum of the toast (or "Murphodynamics") that causes it to land butter-side down. 

For his endeavours Matthews received an Ig Nobel Prize in 1996, which does provide us a great deal of information about the subtle self-defense mechanisms of monsters in the resistentialist environment. They will subtley discredit or turn in to folk-comedy any possibility that they have been unmasked, effectively rendering serious investigation into such ephiphenomenon harmless.

## 4.4 Organisations

**Organisational Statistics**

Operating within the rules and behaviour of organisations is the most common environment in *Papers & Paychecks*, and whilst many a wonderful session of the game can be run without having to delve too deeply into the labyrinth of organisational and corporate law, there is some additional intrigue that can be added to the game when one does so. Thus, when dealing with organisations there are several factors to take into consideration, most of which are pretty simple empirical measures. 

Firstly, there is basic information such as (a) the Name of the Organisation, (b) the location(s) or the organisation, especially the headquarters, (c) when the organisation was formed (and, optionally, by whom), (d) the mission statement of the organisation i.e., a one-line summary of what it actually does. The mission statement must mention the industry that the organisation is involved in.

Secondly, there is the *type* of legal organisation, which will vary according to jurisidiction. In general, the following are common examples which can give an "at a glance" summary of legal status and liabiliy. Note that organisations can own organisations, so that a limited private company may have controlling shares of a limited public company. 

1. The State
The State is the ultimate sovereign decision making power of a geographical area that enforces a system of property rights against internal and external threats, using policing and armies, respectively. A state may, through bilateral and multilateral agreements, or international law, come to agreements with other States on regulating behaviours between them. Within a State, there may be multiple levels of sovereign rights, whether through cofederation, federation, or unitary governments. 
2. Private Company Limited
A very common business entity for small and medium enterprises, where the company does not seek the general public to invest and that the liability of shareholders is limited to the nominal value of the private shares (e.g., Vitol).
3. Public Company Limited
A common structure for large enterprises, where the company trades shares on the stock market, and that the liability of shareholders is limited to the nominal value of the shares (e.g, Citigroup, Shell, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Alphabet, etc).
4. State-owned enterprise
An organisation where the state has a controlling interest in the company, often coupled with public policy objectives as well as commercial interets (e.g., China Petrochemical Corporation, State Grid Corporation of China). They are often introduced to provide services where there is a natural monpoly. 
5. Statutory Authority, Regulatory agency
Organisations established by legislation and with their governance determined by legislation and which is authorised to enact legislation or regulations on behalf of the jurisidiction (e.g., the US Food and Drug Administration).
6. Sole Trader, Partnership
A very common business entity for small enterprises, where the ownership of the company is tied to a small number of individuals, often with equal powers of authority. Liability in sole traders and partnerships is typically unlimited.
7. Worker Cooperatives. A relatively rare enterprise model where ownership is held by worker-members of the enterprise, who either participate in management decisions or elect managers. Often subject their own legislation in some jurisidictions. 
8. Charities, Non-Profits, etc 
An organisation designed to provide a non-profit service. This may be as a recognised charitable organisation, which usually receives a tax-beneficiary status, or for the benefits of members (e.g., the RPG Review Cooperative), which has certain tax exemptions. Sensible bodies are incorporated associations which provide themselves some legal benefit, such as the organisation being a legal person. In unincorporated associations the members carry liability and ownership. 

The more complex the ownership structure, the more probable it is that the controlling interest has established various shell companies etc for the purpose of the less legal practises (e.g., bribery, child labour etc), which can then be wound up and divested when caught. Registering the ultimate controlling authority in tax havens is common among many large enterprises. In *Papers & Paychecks* it is quite possible that logically impossible ownership structures can exist, where company A owns company B, which owns company C, which owns company A. Such breaches of the law of transitivity could not possibly happen where there is different legal codes, right?

Finally, there are the attributes of the organisation. These can be differentiated into the statements of movement (net revenue), statements of position (net assets), and human resources (total employees). Additional details may optionally be added, and are encouraged in the PC Workers (or Adventurers) are associated with an organisation for an extended period of time. For statements of movement this would include line items of revenue and expenditure to generate a profit and loss statement. For statements of position this would include line items of assets and liabilities, to generate a balance sheet. For human resources this would include an organisational chart of authorities and employees, or volunteers. Measure in both quanity and effective full-time workers.

**Weird Organisations**

Just under thirty years ago I was at a friend's party in North Perth and they had just returned from an interstate haul to a fine place called "Polyester Books" (good people, now online shop here: `https://www.polyester.com.au/`). Part of their haul was *High Weirdness By Mail: A Directory of The Fringe: Mad Prophets, Crackpots, Kooks & True Visionaries*, by one Rev. Ivan Stang of the Church of the Sub-Genius, who at least had the humility to list his own group in the directory. The following is a selection of ten example groups, updated as appropriate. Keep in mind that these are (or were) *real* organisations, although the organisational characteristics are *entirely* made up for game purposes and may not have any semblance to what the organisations may actually have. They certainly do serve as sample groups that players in a *Papers & Paychecks* will have to encounter; after all, in this game *high weirdness* is *normal*. Also, remember was the good Rev. Ivan Stang pointed out; they might be right and we're the crazy ones.

*International Flat Earth Research Society*
Summary: Famous for having members all over the globe, the International Flat Earth Society is a biblical-literalist group that argues that the Earth is actually flat and that scientsists (especially NASA) and big government (especially the United Nations) have engaged in a massive deception against the public. In an act of sheer contempt, the United Nations actually displays a true map of the Earth in its logo; the "north pole" is the centre of the the flat earth and the outer extremes are walls of ice. In the age of the Internet, the Flat Eath Society, once virtually defunct, has had a brief rise in popularity, especially among celebrities some of whom might even be trolling.
Type: Non-profit incorporated association
Headquaters: Dover, United Kingdom. 
Mission Statement: To expose the eternal and literal truth that the Earth is flat and to counter the globalist UN and NASA conspiracy that dupes the public into believing that the Earth is a spheroid.
Revenue: $25,000 USD (membership fees, donations, publication sales)
Expenses: $15,000 USD (publications, office expenses, honourium)
Assets: $30,000 USD (bank account, library)
Human Resources: Volunteer committee, one employed part-time. Approximately 500 paid members.

*Joseph Newman Publishing Co.*
Summary: In receipt of some continuing patent payments for developing the first plastic dumbells, Joeseph Newman decided to become a great inventor which would, of course, generate more patent income. Having identified the gyroscopic properties of sub-atomic particles, inventor Joseph Newman has been able to drive energy from them from a combination of magnetic coils and batteries, thus allowing for more energy to be derived from the machine that used in the input. Having made this discovery, a mechanical explanation for Einstein's unified field theory (or so he said), Newman filed for a patent which was rejected on the grounds that it was claiming to be a perpetual motion machine. Newman argued that this he was being persecuted (by the government, big oil, energy companies, etc) and lobbied members of Congress, several of whom put members bills to have patent accepted, despite tests indicating that it simply did not do what it claimed. In 1989, whilst already married, he received a message from God to marry his secretary and her eight-year old daughter; the daughter was removed from his home by the authorities, further evidence of a conspiracy. Afterwardds he was directed by God to run for U.S. President, to avert the extinction of humanity by 1999, as predicted by Nostradamus. The real Joseph Newman died in 2015, although in *Papers & Paychecks* that might just be a conspiracy.
Type: Sole-trader
Headquarters: Lucedale, Mississippi
Mission Statement: To expose the conspiracy that prevents the patent of Newman's energy machine, and to lobby to allow the patent.
Revenue: $55,000 USD (receipts from investments, book sales, lecture tours)
Expenses: $60,000 USD (administrative costs, publication costs, travelling costs)
Assets: $350,000 USD (personal property)
Human Resources: 2 staff (Joseph Newman and personal secretary)

*New Changes Blue Rose Ministry*
Summary: In 1953 Robert Short was contact by an alien, Jon-Al, to go into the Mojave Desert to find a "big rock" (aka Giant Rock), which would become the title of various conventions. From there it was his mission to teach others how to contact aliens, through short wave communications where the aliens would answer questions before they were even asked, a clear indication of telepathy. However the government closed their operation. Associated with Rev. Raymond Broshears, pastor of the sponsoring Church of God of Light, Short went on to form his own church with a holy message. Rev. Robert Short and his inner circle can provide you the secrets to astral travel to visit other planets; one of their regular columnists in their Solar Space Letter newsletter is Ankar22 from Jupiter! "You can learn the mystic connectsion between the Hopi's [sic], the Pope's [sic], and the UFO's [sic]!" Otherworldly space advisor Korton will provide advice on how you can travel to other planets and perhaps even the stars, although the latter requires a great deal of expensive training by Rev. Short.
Type: Non-profit Church
Headquarters: Cornville, Arizona
Mission Statement: To help people get in contact with alien intelligences.
Revenue: $75,000 USD (channelling services, book sales, lecture tours, church donations)
Expenses: $75,000 USD (travelling costs, administrative costs, technical equipment, publication costs)
Assets: $450,000 USD (church property)
Human Resources: 2 staff, 50 church regulars (5 effective full-time workers)

*Battle Cry of Aggressive Christianity, Free Love Ministry*
Summary: A somewhat unsusal addition for *High Weirdness*, as this group is not just *weird* but downright dangerous. A combination of extreme "fire and brimestone" aggressive religious hatred combined with earnest declarations of Christian love. Example: "God does not want liberated women whose thighs twitch with their fornications whilst their wombs gush blood of their murdered children. God does not need painted harlots who smear their faces with with the blood of children". This is apparently about claims cosmetics contain placenta (true fact, kind of, see: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_uses_for_placenta`). This group is probably a little dangerous as they clearly want to die for Jesus and take out as many sinners as possible and have since become "Aggressive Christianity Missionary Training Corps", where they kept more than fifty people in cult-like conditions, developed international contacts, and radio shows. In 2017 the two leaders, Deborah Green and James Green, and their son, Peter Green, where arrested and eventually jailed for over a hundred counts of child abuse, which has put a dent in their operations.  Website still active! See: `http://www.aggressivechristianity.net/`

Headquarters: Fence Lake, New Mexico
Mission Statement: Taking Jesus to all the world. To die for Jesus fighting against sin

## 4.5 Magic Realism Plot Seeds

As mentioned the "monsters" of *Papers & Paychecks* are an example of "magical realism", set in a contemporary environment but with events so strange pushing the borders of acceptable realism. This can be pushed further from just the 'monsters' to narrative devices themselves. If a Boss is short of a plot device there is a very handy Twitter account, Magic Realism Bot (`https://twitter.com/MagicRealismBot`), which through a combination of words and functions produces strange and often curiously insightful sentences that can form wondrous plot devices. Written by Chris and Ali Rodley, the Magic Realism bot, "take[s] a structure or practice (a map, a library, a labyrinth, writing a novel, falling in love, death by firing squad), find its underlying goal or purpose, then exaggerate the structure or practice ad absurdum so that it overfulfils it."

For your convenience, a small selection is provided here of some personal favourite examples culled from the Twitter account over the past three years or so (yes, gentle reader, I have read all of them) that can be used with inserted with strange and comic ease in a *Papers & Paychecks* scenario if a Boss is stuck for an plot device. Obviously, some should be interpreted at least somewhat metaphorically, but the opportunity to find the points where metaphor and reality come together is very enticing. Roll a d100 a couple of times and consult the list, bring the items together in a manner that is entertaining and insightful. Listen to the wild speculations of your PC Workers, smile, and take notes.

# 5.0 Alternate Settings and Scenarios

## 5.1 Scenario: Keep Our Borderlands by Michael Cole and Lev Lafayette

### 5.1.1 Background

The realm of independent book publishers is narrow and constricted. Always the forces of corporate publishers press upon its borders seeking to enslave its consumers, rape its riches (WTF, Gary?!), and establish a monopolistic advantage against any future competitors. If it were not for a stout few many in the industry would indeed fall prey to the evil which surrounds them. You are indeed members of that exceptional class, workers, who are in the employ of the independent publisher, Borderlands in search of workplace recognition and a paycheck that is sufficient to cover ever-increasing rents. Of course you are inexperienced but you have your skills and a heart that cries out for a job well done. You have it in you to become great, but you must gain experience and knowledge, greater skill, and then a more senior position with higher pay ("that's what we tell all the new staff"). There is much to learn - receiving letters from would-be authors and their agents, editing poorly-written manuscripts, going through the crank file in desparation, typesetting, dealing with printers, the sound that deadlines make as they whoosh overhead, warehouses, distribution, the always late payments, and the demanding authors for their cut. 

Ahead, up the slight incline, heading towards Cuba mall of Wellington city, looms the great publisher, Borderlands, a stronghold of civilization, between good business practises and bad. Nearby, among the glistening towers of glass and steel, is the Pyramid of Nile, where fell corporate lackeys wait. All of this you know, but before you venture for your day's work, you must become acquantited with your fellow co-workers, all of you recently having achieved the glory of paid employment. For each workday requires cooperation among all to get anything done, even if Wally over there doesn't seem to do anything at all. Now, as you enter the grim entrance of a soul-crushing menial job with little future in a small, family-owned, publishing company, is the time of exchanging meaningless social pleasantries of the workplace, where deep down all do have a sense of some solidarity with each other, knowing the harrowing experiences that confront them in your first workday ahead.

> Next subject, Kowalski, Leon, engineer, waste disposal, file section, new employees, six days.   
> -- opening words of Blade Runner

Please note that this scenario for *Papers & Paychecks* refers to a publishing and distribution company called "Nile", which is readily admitted in a satirical alternative to another company that has a book trade and also a name of a particularly long river. It has nothing to do with the company "The Nile" which distributes books online which apparently came after "our" Nile written up and playtested. It seems that once again that reality is imitating fiction. 

There is also a sideways glance here to Borders bookstore which underwent liquidation in 2011, and does not in any way refer to Borderlands Book Store of 866 Valencial Street, San Francisco, which specialises in fantasy, science fiction, mystery, and horror - except to encourage everyone within reasonable distance to go visit them and buy some books; more power to your arm. 

**Notes About Borderlands**

The PC Workers in "Keep Our Borderlands" have just joined a medium-sized family-owned publishing house with some fifty employees. The whole place is well organised for security and logistics. Despite the description work here is carried out at pace that doesn't damage quality of work. "More haste, less speed" is a proverb that owner Castel Border expresses with the sort of regularity that his wife may one day make a claim for justifiable homicide. It is, indeed, his entire business logic. Eschewing any desire to expand the business, happy with the stable and existing distribution lines for thirty years, using the same printers, the same warehousing company, and many of the same authors. Indeed, there is a mind-numbing sense of sameness about the place. Fortunately, there have bene equipment upgrades, courtesy of the recommendations of the younger son, Leoland Border.

The main non-player characters of Borderlands publishing house are Castel Border, Stellan Border, Leoland Border, and Seneca Philosophus. Castel Border is the silver-haired, pin-striped suit, elderly, cantankerous, and yet quite clever owner of the business. Now in his seventies, he inherited the business from his father and has kept the ship steady, "steady she goes" is yet another of his annoying pearls of wisdom that will be recited several times a day. His two sons are Stellan Border and Leoland Border with the main inheritence of the store almost certainly going to Stellan. Castel has the role of general manager.

Stellan Border is a kindly gentleman in his early fifties who dresses in an unassuming navy suit with fine selection of paisley ties. In many ways he's very much like his father, in terms of disposition and a sense of an unhurried approach, but he is largely lacking in business acumen and has an appaling sense of timing. Throughout the story, is almost certain that he will turn up when the PC workers are busy and then not be able to found when he is needed. Stellan never had an unkind word for anybody, not even his brother, of whom he has suspicions. Stellan is charge of author and agent liaison, where his natural charm shines, and content production, where he can get in the way.

Leoland Border is a pleasant and friendly man in his mid-forties, solid and well-built (he works out at the gym every morning), typically dressed in a very sharp Hackett charcoal black suit, thin-tie and perfect-white shirts. Even remotely astute observers will notice his sense of taste for well-known items that carry a price-tag, including a Rolex watch and a Mont Blanc pen. Always attentive, despite being very busy he will book an appointment for any worker who wishes to see him; "my door is always open" is his annoying platitude. Leoland is in charge of accounts and distribution, as well as improving the technological systems at Borderlands.

Leoland's Hackett suit, Rolex watch, and Mon Blanc pen are actually monsters in league with each other and acting in concert to control Leoland and lead him down his existing path of a desire for power and wealth. All three engage in long-term and subtle mental attacks at appropriate times and have led to a situation where Leoland is actually totally in their control. As a result of his divulgence of business secrets, Leoland is actually secretly working for Nile and receiving a very nice stipend for this gradual activity of corporate espionage that is gradually bringing Borderlands to its knees. The plan is for Nile to eventually take over Borderlands and Leoland will take that top position as manager of a local content branch; Castel will face a lonely retirement somewhere remote in the South Island and Stellan will be driven out of the business. The monsters however have no intention of letting up at this point and will drive Leoland to even more nefarious deeds. 

The three items represent and target Freudian aspects of their personality, the Hackett suit representing Leolan's environmental needs (their id), the Rolex watch reminding them of the control that the external social world has on them (their superego), and the Mont Blanc pen for their introspection and expression (their ego). If separated from his items their power will gradually diminish and Leoland will come to his senses (of sorts). "A holiday", whether in a literal sense such as a few months in Fiji, or in the figuartive sense as in a period in "The Big House" for fraud, would actually do a world of good for Leoland.

Sofia Seneca is a professional and highly-organised woman of an Italian background, who is the very picture of a modern business woman. She will be the main contact and manager of the PC workers, and whilst she has a lot to do (effectively, she is the one that keeps everything working on a day-by-day level), she will always act as a patron to the PC workers. Like Stellan and Leoland, she works directly for Castel. Sofia will provide the PC Workers and introduction to their work, which at least on paper is as varied and appropriate to their profession. She will take the opportunity for daily meetings with the PC Workers to be as helpful as possible. In the course of their various mundane duties (and, my god, are they mundane), the PC Workers will determine, as the facts speak for themselves, that Borderlands is under serious trouble due the introduction of the multinational Nile to their local industry.

If and when a PC Worker raises the matter, Sofia will introduce the PC Workers to a new employment opportunity - infiltrating Nile and engaging in corporate intelligence gathering, reconaissance, and even espionage. This is of course explained out-of-the-office and with sufficient security precautions. A vast room in an abandoned warehouse on the docks is a good location. Sofia will show the PC Workers several appropriate job offers that have come up at Nile, a company whose local office is already five times the size of Borderlands. Glowing references from several defunct companies are provided to ensure the successful applications of the PC Workers. Obviously, while they are employed by Nile they are also working at Borderlands - and what PC Worker would turn down the opportunity for double pay?

## 5.1.2 The Outside

With a clear task before them, the PC Workers will almost certainly want to investigate Nile. The following are availble, apart from the most mundane corporate information on their website, and a surprising number of complaints from consumers unhappy with the customer service of their warehouse direct book sales.

**The Manic Street Preacher (aka The Mad Hermit)**

At a book-signing, reading, or similar event at Borderlands, a character who makes a successful Sense (Sight, Hearing, Smell) roll will notice a rough-looking elderly man standing outside in a dirty overcoat, the tell-tale sign of a bottle in a brown-bag sticking out of his coat pocket, rheumy eyes, a greying and unkempt beard, and a significant odour etc. For all intents and purposes this seems to be one of many unfortunate members of society whom life and the economic system has given a bad hand. However, what is quite different about this individual is that they are parading back and forth with a hand-made sign which states "The End is Nile!". Not only that but the individual also rants about how Nile is seeking to take over every book publisher, every distributor, every bookstore, and then they'll move on to radio, television and even (and especially) the Internet. "And then they will control all the information! And they'll have control of you! And you! And you!", as he points manically at indifferent or worried pedestrians.

When pressed further the Manic Street Preacher will continue on a similar theme, and will start dropping names of ranking employees of Nile and of Borderlands, and indeed seems very familiar with the various operations of Borderlands. If more than two PC Workers start paying him attention however, he will attempt to flee the scene in a dramatic manner making comments about how is being chased by spooks. Following him will eventually lead to his home, such as it is, an a disused lavatory in the cellar of a local council building which, like all such places, is both missing the light and the stairs (the Manic Street Preacher knows the way down). Also on the door of the lavatory is a sign that says "Beware of the Leopard", and they're not kidding either. In this case "Leopard" is a particularly large and savage domestic Savannah cat who dearly loves his human staff and will take advantage of the dark to engage in sneak attacks.

Getting past the Manic Street Preacher and Leopard is quite revealing. Among his scant normal possessions are several old scientific books that were distributed through Borderlands, various old company records from Borderlands, more recent documents from Nile (he's done some dumpster diving), and many scribbled notes about the corporate strategy from Nile and their attempts to take over Borderlands and other media. One will even find a small box containing a few hundred dollars, and a passport which reveals his identity as Alderman Border.

Every family has skeletons in their closet, and some more than others, and Alderman Border is the skeleton for the Border family. Once the brightest and first son of Castel and in charge of their now defunct distribution of academic texts, Alderman could see the threat posed by Nile but lacked the administrative and communicative skills to express his concerns effectively. Seeking solace in bottles of strong alcoholic beverages alternating with serotonergic psychedelics, Alderman became increasingly speculative with his opinions on Nile's intentions. Never a great administrator his work began to slide leading to the collapse of the academic distribution line, which was eagerly taken up by Nile. This simply confirmed his fears and increased his rantings until the day came that Leoland had to forcibly remove him from the building. He still returns at times with his placard to berate and accost anyone who crosses his path and makes eye contact. When there is nobody around Stellan will take him aside to have a quiet word about his diet and hygeine, ask how the cat is, and slip him some money.

**Due Authority (aka The Lizard Men)**

Any half-competent Internet research on Nile and their activities in New Zeland will result in discovering the "Due Authority" website. "Due Authority" is a pro-monarchist, New Zealand nationalist (yes, there is really such a thing), and anti-foreign investment group, whose political opinions stray from the wingnut right to the moonbat left, but never in-between. The following is a good example of one of their posts, concerning any potential to the chage of the New Zealand flag, which inspired the formation of the group.

"Hey, don't mean to freak y'all out (actually, yes I do!) but there's a lot more to this NZ flag change malarkey than most people realise...

A change of flag means not only that we have taken a major step to removing the DUE AUTHORITY of the crown. It also means we take away the very power which enforces both the 1981 Bill of Rights Act (the closest thing NZ has to an entrenched Constitution) and the founding plank upon which the Treaty of Waitangi has meaning.

"It does not matter if you're pro or anti monarchy but if you take away the DUE AUTHORITY of law (which includes our flag) you then open the gates of hell, or to be precise the means in which John Key can legally sign the TPPA (Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement). Currently if the matter was taken to court it would undoubtedly end up at the Supreme Court." 

The post continues to explain how the attempt to change the New Zealand flag is actually a conspiracy by a number of politicians who want to change the way that judges are appointed, which can then lead to the removal of various political rights (they're especially keen on "freedom of speech"), ban "proper" religious teachings (they have a special interpretation of the bible which obviously doesn't involve organised religion, they're part of the conspiracy), rework the education system to make people more compliant and so forth.

Despite all this there does seem to be a kernel of truth in their writings about Nile. At least the facts seem accurate and in accord to other published information concerning the size of the company, its senior staff, its operations and so forth. More to the point the make it very clear on their website that they have *secret* information about Nile corporation which they will only divulge to "genuine freedom fighters".

"Due Authority" are located in a well-built, if small, former Baptist Church in one of the poorer areas of the city (Newtown), where they have a New Age store which sells various crystals, homeopathic cures ("just add water"), resin statues of dragons and faeries etc. Beyond that there is the bookstore which has a range of books on numerology, the secrets of the (insert ancient or contemporary religious tradition), UFOs, and political texts on the Freemasons, the Illumaniti, the Rosicrucians, the international banking cartels, vaccinations, Chemtrails, HAARP, Deep State, and so forth. Then there's "the really serious stuff", as one helpful bookshop seller will explain, on New Zealand nationalism and anti-Roman Christianity and how NZ is actually the last remaining vestige of deceny in the world run by perverts. 

If the PC Workers ask about Nile and the special secret information it will be explained that they don't give that information away to anyone. To test their sincerity they will be invited back to a "special meeting" in two days time and given several books to read on the special identity of New Zealand and of Nile Corporation. The books are overpriced and the shop only takes cash. If an attempt is made to pay be credit card the purchaser will be sold another book on how RFID chips in cards are a vector to them compulsory as implants in people. The books will take 12 strategic turns to read due the intricate complexity that is contained and a successful Formidable (15+) Investigate check is required to remember the finer details, which the PC Workers will be quizzed on at the meeting.

The books will contain information on how Nile is actually a company headed and financed by people of Anglo-Egyptian backgrounds, who have taken the various motifs and forms of ancient Egypt as part of their corporate identity. The former is well known, indeed obvious, but the latter checks out on with other sources. The books go into a great deal of research into the backgrounds of the financiers which indicates some fairly serious research on the part of the author, Zacharia Aleph. The books then go onto a fairly in-depth discussion about various aspects of Egyptian mythology, most of which again seems to be fairly accurate. 

What is more speculative however is that the people behind Nile corporation are actually a group of Ancient Egyptian pagans who are seeking to take over the world, and are using their book distribution network to funnel information and control, and that this has been ongoing since the end of the second world war (i.e., well before Nile was founded). Aleph shows, in notable detail, how various members of the families associated with Nile where involved in a number of well-known historical events ranging from the assasination of Kennedy, the Moon landings, the sacking of Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, Watergate, the rise of Gorbachev, the fall of communism, the introduction of a commercial Internet, 9/11, and so forth. The power of Nile is really quite surprising!

If the PC Workers finish the books an attend the meeting they will be introduced by various "Brothers" and "Sisters" and will be required to donn masks, to ensure anonymity. They will be introduced as "Brother" or "Sister" as desired will a new name, representing their "secret identity" as part of "Due Authority". They will be then quizzed on the contents of the books that they passed. If they PC Workers pass the tests the author of the books, and head of Due Authority will explain how the financiers and senior management of Nile corporation are actually secretly shape-shifting Nile River crocodiles. Which eat people, obviously.

**BMX Kids (aka The Bandits)**

The BMX Kids are a group of several mostly male adolescents aged between 12 and 15 who scoot around the city on the own BMX bikes. When out-of-office (just before arriving at work, leaving work, lunch break) one or more PC Workers will notice these urchins in a local laneway and overhear (Sense (Hearing), TN 7) one exclaim excitedly, "There's Post-It (TM) note under the keyboard!". If a PC worker looks down the laneway they will notice a number of the youngsters "dumpster diving" among some discarded computer parts. A Knowledge (General) skill check (TN 9) or Craft (computing) (TN 9) will ascertain that the excitement is about discovering someone's password.

If approached the BMX Kids will be extremely wary and may even attempt to flee, however appropriate coaxing (Seduce skill, using bribery, TN 7) will encourage them to stay and talk. The three main bandits, High-Fly (famed for their big jumps), Emu (an Australian), and The Code (a bespectacled girl) will do most of the talking and despite being the seniors among the game (i.e., they're 14-15) they are just as prone to having loose lips when it comes to describing their criminal abilities. Specifically the BMX Kids will claim that there isn't a computer or building that they can't get into, "for a price", The Code adds. If a price is requested, High-Fly will blurt out "Five hundred dollars!", causing Emu to grimace. Kindly PC Workers may offer them double that, just to ensure their loyalty.

The reality is that these are just kids; they do have some skills in the areas that they think they are the city's best, but they are not professional criminals by any stretch of the imagination, although a particularly Machiavellian party will find a "patsy" use for them. Given their age they will have characteristics around 25%  lower than their adult levels (a more fine-grained description of section 1.4 Characteristics, in the core rulebook). They also have a full complement of background skills. The BMX Kids have typically swapped "Pilot" for "Bike" in their background skills, and have a bonus to Stealth (and other skills) on account of their relatively size. 

One interesting identifier for the group is that they talk in late 1970s slang and have preference for 1970s pop music, even including the Bay City Rollers for some incomprehensible reason. They see the 1970s as the origins of BMX and hold the era in some awe. If any PC Worker can convingly describe the period with first-hand knowledge and used a BMX bike at the time they will be treated with respect if not outright awe. They will be challenged of course, with requests to sing "Shang-a-Lang", and other atrocious tunes from the period.

*Slang*

The following are some example slang terms that the BMX Kids will use. A Knowledge (general) skill check at -2 is required to work out what the hell they are talking about, unless the character was in their teens or twenties in the 1970s.

"Do me a solid" i.e., "Can you do me a favour?"
"Boogie down!" i.e., "Let's party!"
"Keep on truckin'", i.e., "Keep doing what you're doing and be confident"
'The Man', Everything from government, bosses, and parents.
'10-4', i.e., "Affirmative", from Citizen's Band slang
'Bear', 'Smokey' i.e., "A police officer", from Citizen's Band slang
'Space cadet' i.e., "A person with an interest in science and not paying attention to other cool things".
'Skinny', i.e., "The whole and deep truth"
'Grok', i.e., "To deeply understand'
'Bum trip', i.e., "A bad situation"
'See you on the flipside', i.e., "See you tomorrow'

### 5.1.3 Nile, Ground Floor

Based on the foreshore of Wellington and having received city council approval to remove several old warehouses, the Pyramid of Nile is a massive ediface of glass and steel in the same propostions as the Great Pyramid of Giza, although at 1/10th of the size. It stands 23 metres per side and 14.6 metres tall, not including an extra 2 metres of radio attenae, with an incline of 51 degrees, with the sides of the square base at cardinal points. Whilst some architects have marvelled at the iconic building, town planners have argued that the Pyramid of Nile is an inefficient desing for a city such as Wellington where flat land is at a premium. More cynical economists have noted that perhaps the primary business of Nile is not book distribution, but real estate speculation.  

The pyramid has long range security cameras mounted on the angles, each of which have a range of 100m, and three at each entrance, two facing along the opposite base, and one facing ahead. At the second level there are, obviously, no entrance based security cameras, but there are cameras facing downwards along the pyramid angles to ensure that nobody is climbing up. There is no security cameras on the third level. Within the building there is a basic motion detector, alarm system, and short-range/wide angle camera is each major room and corridor.

The computer system consists of an overall network, plus VLANs with wired and wireless access for each department which requires network administrator access to enter from oustide. Use of VPNs from home to the office are common. The archives and data centre for the company is on the first floor and is known among the staff as "The Minotaur's Maze" on account of the confusing layout.

The ground floor consists of four entrances into the Pyramid of Nile, one general business and the occasional public (such as school trips), two entrances for truck bound deliveries (inwards and outwards), and one entrance for transport inbound and outbund shipping. At each entrance there is a guard post and first aid centre, and nearby is the fire panel for the floor. The staff at the trucking and shipping entrances are notably more surly than those at the public entrance, and the public entrance also have two reception staff. The Security staff are not armed, but do have access to a police emergency button. Twice during the night time one security guards from each station will take a walk around the perimeter to ensure that everything is fine; it's a fair walk and will take the guards a good twenty minutes to complete the 1.6km trek. At all times at least one security guard has Survival skill representing their first and second aid training.

Nota bene: Set in New Zealand, where Commonwealth English predominates, the first level is typically referred to as the "ground floor", and the second level as the "first floor", and the third level as the "second floor". This may be different to what U.S. readers are more familiar with.

**G1 Business Entrance**

The business entrance to Nile Corporation is a large open area of marble and chrome, rather like business hotel lobby. A reception desk has two staff who check-in visitors and issue identity cards for staff and passes for visitors. These cards cover all the rooms for the ground level and first level, but not level two. In addition there are two well-dressed and friendly security staff during the daytime, replaced with more surly staff in the evening. Using "Generic Security Guard" and "Generic Receptionist" for statistics.

*G1, G2, G3 Generic Security Guard*

The generic security guard is big, burly, but also professional. Nile has been very careful to select security guards with the right disposition and experience and their selection of guards has been very successful. These security guards will do everything by the book and record that they did it by the book. Note that some security guards have one level less in Profession in favour of Survival, representing their first aid training.

*G2 Generic Reception Staff*

The reception staff are, as per the generic gender and age roles so common in a corporate environment, young and female. Again however, like the security staff, Nile takes pride in the quality and professionalism and these staff, and encourages them from this early start in their career to follow the company procedures.

Housed within the business entrance, but against the outside glass is a coffee shop, appropriately entitled "Hobgoblins", which apparently the leaseholders think is a selling point. It sells the usual fare that one would find in such places, but of the worst possible quality. The coffee is invariably burnt, the milk is probably past its use-by date, the cakes are dry (and yet so full of sugar you'll need to be scrapped off the ceiling). The cafe's hours are indiscernable as well, and appear to be random (for all purposes in a game session, they are - there's a 50% chance that they'll be open at some stage during 8am to 5pm).

The staff are three burly women with a colourful command of the English language. At any one time one of them will be outside having a cigarette. They do not take too kindly to any complaints about the quality of their coffee, tea, or food and woe to anyone who does so; one of the staff members keeps a good supply of "Micky Finns" in her purse and will slip it in a consumable if anyone has a problem, whilst feigning concern; it will be the equivalent of 6 therapeutic doses (c.f., Heroin, Opiates, Barbiturates, and other 'Downers' section 2.2, *Papers & Paychecks*).

One advantage of the location however is that some visitors from another related company (shipping, printing supplies, couriers, whatever) are also at the coffee shop when the PC Workers make their first visit. A standard Sense (Hearing) check (TN 7) will mean they will over-hear a conversation on how they dislike dealing with Nile, how they've been wronged, and how they would like to get back at them. This is an opportunity for PC Workers to find some outside allies who are prepared to do some damage to Nile, pro bono.

**G2 Incoming Land Deliveries ("The Orcs")**

With a far less salabrious entrance, a stream of trucks make their way here for incoming supplies. During the day there are at four storers and packers to move and stack boxes, and engage in stock control. In the evening there are two security guards, who spend most the night taking an occasional walk outside or not really viewing the security camera feed. Use the G1 Generic Security Guard statistics and the G2 Generic Storer and Packer stastics. There is also a forklift and several trolleys present.

There is about 30 day shift packers and 20 night shift packers on duty in the incoming land delivery, outgoing land delivery, and sea delivery offices, with one supervisor for each room and shift (use generic supervisor). The packers take great delight in shocking people with their colourful, coase, and sexual language and their propensity to have scantily-clad beauties on calendar displays (the few female members of staff have provided their own version of well-buffed firemen in similar poses). Many are experts at union regulations for occupational health and safety and can quote vebatim if the need arises.

Whilst they will bicker among themselves, constantly, they will also band together with alarming speed if there is any perceived threat to their workplace solidarity. By this they primarily mean not having to work too hard. The night-shift workers have become particularly expert at this, and have even mapped out where to avoid all the cameras within the floor, just in case someone needs a quick nap.

Almost needless to say the supervisors are not held in high-regard by the packers. If, by some miracle, the PC Workers manage to get the packers onside they can provide information of where to stand and walk pretty much throughout all of level one and not be seen by the security cameras, as well as the provision of protective clothing, overalls, and coaching in union regulations which can stop most questions from other staff on level one and two.

*Generic Storer and Packers*

Usually male (there is one female S&P staff member incoming land deliveries), storers and packers tend to alternate between two professions, labourer and administrator, as their job involves moving goods, storing them, and keeping stock control. This is not great for their pay-rates or for that matter their need to be both strong and wise, but at least gives them the combined perks of both professions simultaneously.

**G3 Outgoing Land Deliveries**

In all ways identical to G2 Incomimg Land Deliveries, except the value-added products depart from this point. As per G2 there are four storers and packers during the day and two security guards during the night. Use the G1 Generic Security Guard statistics and the G2 Generic Storer and Packer stastics.

**G4 Incoming and Outgoing Sea Deliveries**

Again, similar to G2 and G3, except the storemen here handle both incoming and outgoing goods for sea delivery and movement to the nearby docks. Use the G1 Generic Security Guard statistics and the G2 Generic Storer and Packer stastics. These are of a larger but less frequent volume, and the presence of several forklifts and only a few trolleys is a result of the difference. One of these forklifts is a monster, as is the security camera. The forklift enjoys pranking the storers and packers by moving pallets when there is nobody about, and the camera enjoys being in on the joke as well. 

**G5 Janitors' Storeroom ("The Shunned Cavern")**

Located behind the Sea Deliveries and next the toilets is the ground floor Janitors' Storeroom. The two janitors are two brothers Yuri and Boris, are migrants from Kalingrad, Russia. Of similar height and build the main way to tell the two apart is that Yuri is the contemplative and morose one, whereas Boris is outgoing and belligerent. True to the stereotype of such individuals they are both massive, with thick accents, and thoroughly unpleasant to almost everyone. Plus, they love to drink although they are wise enough to know that drinking at work is prohibited - so they disguise the smell of drinking alcohol with vast quantities of cleaning alcohol. In addition to several bottles of vodka carefully hidden in their storeroom Yuri and Boris also have a vast array of cleaning products, of which several when mixed together could possibly contravene the Geneva Convention on Chemical Weapons.

This said, both Yuri and Boris are loyal to those whom they've developed a grudging respect for, which includes the Nile corporation. Getting them onside would beneficial, as they are prepared to carry out small additional tasks for appropriate gifts. Their cleaning shift starts in the early hours of the morning and finished just before lunchtime, starting from the ground floor and working their way up. Note that Yuri and Boris do have passes that work for the top level of the Nile pyramid, however they are carefull encoded to work between 10.30am and 11.30am only. The janitors also have the additional role of being morning shift building wardens which means that they can operate the fire panels, and clear the floors for real or imagined fires. If they latter in place, staff will return after thirty minutes.

**G6 Production and Distribution Room ("Kobolds")**

This large 'n' shaped room is staffed almost entirely by young men and women aged from 16 to 19, with the exception of a small number of older supervisors who are in their early 20s. The workers here are responsible entirely for the printing and the physical movement of various goods within the Nile offices and the transfer of books, periodicals etc, to outbound sources.

The place is one of extraordinary chaos and seems to operate more due to luck than effective organisation. Overall there are about thirty staff who scoot about here who apparently are too busy to stop and talk to anybody even, and especially, their supervisors. If one is cornered and asked a question, they'll find an escape route and then flee ("Hang-on, I’ll just need to check..." - and then never come back).

Some bright spark thought it was a good idea to give all these workers a special Nile uniform, loosely based on the uniform of the Egyptian police. As a result is quite easy to confuse who is who on the floor, and activity which the staff take some delight in. "Oh no, I'm John, not Joe.  Joe was just down here, hang on, I'll go and check.."

Another aspect among these teenaged pranksters is that the almost every object in the building seems to be trapped in some way. Computer and power cables serve as highly effective trip-wires, pot plants seem to be positioned on desks designed to cause cascading collapses of files, and even desks are positioned in such a position that people will clip their upper thigh (or worse) as they go past. Printer's ink is an especially delightful staining material. Polished floors are *so* slippery. Curiously, the staff never seem to get caught by these traps.

There has been a succession of supervisors in this office, mostly business graduates straight up of university. After all, how difficult could it be to manage a bunch of high-school drop-outs, right? Two have returned to university for a second degree in adolscent psychology, one has decided to move to Masterton and become a shepherd, and another, tragically, had a nervous breakdown and has had be institutionalised.

Tucker's Kobolds actually feel bad about the last one. They're pranksters, and their pranks are meet to frustrate rather than cause harm. Yes, "Tucker's Kobolds" is what they call themselves, and they're led a seemingly non-descript individual named Tucker. Every Saturday night ringleaders meet at his house, and over movies and popcorn they work out what dastardly tricks they'll play the following week. 

For all their mischief, they are actually fairly productive, and for this reason the chaos of the Production and Distribution has not been subject to senior management intervention. If one could manage to befriend Tucker or his ringleaders - and they do operate on a dictum of "don'trust anyone who isn't our age" - they would find a very useful ally as they are in charge of all the internal mail.

**G7 Secretarial Pool ("The Goblins", "The Ogre")**

Located behind the business reception and with access to the main lifts and the production and distribution room, this "U" shaped office serves as a complement to "The Kobolds" in terms of business logic and a counter-point to "The Orcs" in terms of characters and disposition. The twenty staff here are the backbone administrators of the company, mainly female, constantly in motion, and managing to look extremely busy and overworked.

This things are not quite untrue, in reality, they are very good at deflecting work, especially among each other. Indeed, it is not uncommon for a particular task to circulate around the office ("Jenny, could you do this for me? I'm so busy at the moment") until it comes back to the person who was originally supposed to do it. In addition to deflecting work, the secretarial pool is very impressive at their knowledge office gossip and office politics. They know exactly who is doing what with whom, and how often, and even any level of involvement with the group will quickly become an induction into this dirty laundry, which could certainly be useful to the purposes of the PC Workers. Note however, like most gossip it has a tenuous relationship with the truth at best.

The head of the team is an extremely competent administrator, Bree Yark, who is not above engaging in this rumour mill herself. Whenever an administrator is stuck with a particularly complex problem and their immediate colleagues cannot help (such as contradictory procedures), a cry will come up from the floor where he name is simply exclaimed in full: "Bree Yark!" Contrary to popular belief this does not sound anything like "Hey Rube" and Bree herself instituted the practise. It has become code for "We surrender!". This will happen several times a day.

In a private office beyond the secetarial poll (G7a) is Al Bear who is one of the few male members of this highly-gendered pool and unsurprisingly is the floor manager, although he is also technically in charge of the other staff on this level as well. Al is a big guy, of Maori background, with bushy beard, red-checked flanellette shirt, and spray-on jeans. He is also as camp as a row of tents. He and Bree get along very well, sharing all sorts of comical stories of internal office shenanigans and affairs; especially affairs. Al Bear's nickname is "The Ogre" on account of his great size. After all, calling him something like "Owl Bear" would be ridiculous. Who would stick an owl's head on a bear? 

Bree and Ogre are in deep cohoots with each other, with Bree typically finding ways to prevent access to Ogre ("he's a very busy man"). Further, they have accumulated a great deal of serious dirt on all their fellow employees, and despite Bree's feigned behaviour, they actually have a good idea of what is true and alse rumours. Note that Bree does not have special social skills in hiding her deceptions, so a capable PC Worker will be able to differentiate between true and false gossip coming from her.

This can be both a disaster or a benefit for the PC Workers. By accumulating the collective research skills of her staff, Bree Yark can create quite a dossier on the PC Workers. However, both Bree and Al are also prone to expensive tastes, and, with some consideration, get the PCs out of a difficult situation with an appropriate "gift".

### 5.1.4 Nile, First Floor

The second level of Nile is primarily for what are effectively salespeople and customer relations, even though they all go by the name "Business Development Managers". Not that they manage anybody, but having "manager" on their curriculum vitae looks good when they leave the first and apply for work at other companies. Little do they know that if they ever do leave the firm, Nile has a series of operatives to ensure that their period of unemployment will be long and painfully, and when they crawl back begging for re-employment, the gracious Nile will provide it to them - at a much reduced salary.

In a perverse inversion of certain other companies in the real world, the manual and directly productive workers in Nile have the sort of workplace that is actually fairly good from a worker's perspective, and in some ways even beneficial for productivity. "A happy worker is a productive worker", or so the saying goes. On this level however, the workloads are excessive, and the workers - sorry "professionals", as they like to call themselves - are definitely not happy at all. With nearly all believing however that the path to success is through unpaid overtime and backstabbing one's fellow worker's it is unlikely that they are going to be happy any time soon.

The main exception to this sordid set of affairs is Archives and Information Technology, a small team which manages physical records and a modest datacentre. Whilst their in-group camadraderie is exceptional, mainly because of a range of similar interests and worldview, their view of the rest of the company is perhaps too honest, if such a thing can exist. They know exactly what sort of company Nile is, and what sort of people their cow-orkers on this level are like - and they're not particularly fond of them.

**F1 Customer Relations ("The Bugbears")**

There is approximately fifteen people working in customer relations, each with their own small office, with a number of modest-sized business meeting rooms. It is here that potential clients are taking for briefings, as well as were job interviews (such as those for the PCs) are conducted. The meeting rooms have the sort of sterile and disheartening atmosphere that empowers the presenters, and acts as a psychic attack on the visitors - and this is meant in a very literal sense.

The Projector is a dangerous and malicious object that seems to feed of the killer vibes of Nile's Customer Relations professionals. When giving a presentation, The Projector uses the hum of the equipment and gentle smell of burning dust to engage in a subtle psychic attack on multiple visiting targets in the room, causing Mental Bruises, and even Mental Wounds if they have to sit through a particularly long session. The effects of the Bruises is to causes despondancy and despair among the recipients; if they are reduced to zero bruises, they were be willing to come to an agreement over whatever grievance they had with Nile, or agree to a new contract etc, with modifications according to the "reasonableness" of what is being offered. 

The Customer Relations team, unsurprising, has a very good reputation within the company for Getting Things Done, and having a very successful run of negotiated contracts. They consider customers who have an issue to be "bugs", and that they have to support such customers; hence "bugbears". What is perhaps less well-known, or at the very least overlooked, is the rampant use of amphetamines and cocaine among the staff, of which at least ten of the fifteen are seriously addicted.

Amongst all this, this is one potential ally for the PC Workers, albeit a slightly annoying one. John "Moose" Seddon actually hates working for Nile, but a worker has to pay the mortgage. Whilst John will be able to assist to the best of their ability in various acts of corporate espionage, once he believes he's part of the PC Workers group, he will start expressing his political ideology - Posadism.

> **Posadism: A Summary**   
>   
> Homero Rómulo Cristalli Frasnelli was an Argentian socialist from the 1940s onwards who was referred to as 
> Juan Posadas. Posadas was active in the trade union and Trotskyist socialist movements becoming a notable 
> leader of that group in Latin America with notable influence among Cuban railway workers, Bolivian tin 
> miners, and Brazilian agricultural workers. When Trotsky's Fourth International split in 1953, Posadas 
> joined with the "International Secretariat of the Fourth International", but left that organisation 
> several years later, forming the Fourth International Posadist. Their political parties usually went by 
> the name "Revolutionary Workers Party", under the belief that other Trotskyist parties were not 
> revolutionary enough.
>   
> Apart from being a fairly orthodox Trotskyist movement in other regards, the  Posadists were notable for   > two famously exceptional theories. Firstly, was their advocacy of nuclear war. The Posadists argued that a > nuclear war between the Stalinist regimes and capitalist regimes was inevitable and ought to be 
> *encouraged*, as the surviving members of the species - primarily in the Third World - would build 
> socialism out of it the remains. "Nuclear war equals revolutionary war" is a Posadist slogan.
>  
> The second notable component of the Posadists was their interest in UFOs. The Posadists argue that there 
> must be alien civilizations in the universe and such societies, which are obviously highly advanced, must > also follow the trajectory of history. Such societies must have already reached an advanced stateless 
> communist society. As a result, Posadasits call open aliens to directly intervene in Earth-world politics.
>  
> "We must call upon beings from other planets when they come to intervene, to collaborate with the 
>  inhabitants of the Earth to overcome misery. We must launch a call on them to use their resources to help > us."   
> -- Juan Posadas 
>
> It is important to remember that with the exception of these more unusual political positions, the 
> Posadists are an all other ways an orthodox Trotskyist political organisation - as a quick review of
> a current webiste (yes, they are still with us) will reveal: `http://posadiststoday.com/`.
>   
> Long live Posadas!

**F2 Sales and Marketing ("The Gnolls")** 

At first sight it seems that this space is largely empty. Further investigation will reveal the evidence of streamers, discarded champagne bottle, and a easy search check will reveal an indictable commercial quantity of cocaine, distributed across several tables. Nile believes that Sales & Marketing (also known as S&M on account of their kinks) is the most important part of the company and they are treated with significant leeway as long as they keep on generating good results. Whilst most of the staff are out schmoozing, i.e., "meeting clients" and getting the big contracts and engaging in a number of corporate expansions, there will be a handful (less than six) staff here during any day shift finishing off various bits of paperwork and doing a few lines to keep themselves "alert".

If any of the PCs prove themselves to be sufficiently interesting party animals to the sales and marketing staff (a strategic turn of engaging in their drug-fueled activities, being extremely liberal with their money and open about when they're run out, plus a successful skill competition in general knowledge) then they'll gain themselves a temporary ally who will can contribute to some pretty impressive marketing - either positive or negative throughout the company. Some choice comments dropped to Bree Yark's team usually gets things going quite niceley.

**F3 Archives ("The Minotaur")**

The final room on this level has the least number of stuff, but also the greatest floor space per staff member. The company archives consist of two physical and areas, a maze of archive boxes stacked full of archive boxes containing the physical records of the company, and a smaller maze of a data centre, which Nile engages in a modicum of data analytics and projections. In both cases the rooms are quite confusing, both in terms of the layout and the fact that none of the workers seem to care for lighting except when absolutely necessary. Being quite anti-social the place is also eerily silent except the hum of computer systems (becoming a screaming pitch inside the data centre itself), the breathing of a hidden staff members, and their slow and purposeful footsteps when they are stalking an intruder.
 
The chief librarian of the company, with a notable "straw blonde" horned hairstyle, is known throughout the company as "the battle axe" on account of her aggressive temperment. She takes the company security very seriously and privileges are requires to enter the archives (and the data centre for that matter). If the PC workers somehow have the appropriate authorisation and she doesn't know about she'll let them through but express her complete horror that she has not been given prior notification and fire off a terse email "upstairs". There will be at least two strategic turns before this is acted on. Ude is also responsible for allowing visitors to the third level and keeps the appoints for the three senior executives there. She is very busy woman.

Also working in the area are the highly anti-social data scientis and systems administrator both of whom barely talk to each other let alone outsiders. The systems administrator is seriously overworked but manages to keep not only all the personal computer systems in the company going, but also the 36 servers, switches and fabric, and the drive array in the data centre. They do consider the data centre the priority (which is true on  technical level) rather than dealing with user-level support, despite management telling them  they need to be more responsive to user need. Management is, of course, deaf to the suggestion that perhaps another sysadmin to deal with user-level issues is advised. The sysadmin has a rather bad reputation throughout the company, mainly because most the staff don't even know the data centre exists, and if they do the don'think it requires maintanence. The sysadmin treats breaches of data security in the same way the chief librarian does.

The data scientist, Mike T'set ("Call me 'M'") is an awfully tedious math-nerd who has managed to waste all many of company time providing unusual correlations in their studies of big data. To their credit they are the only person who has managed to develop a 90% accurate prediction of the staff movements of Hobgoblins cafe. Nile once developed an entire range of left-handed books on the scientists' proposed discovery that they could corner the market of left-handed readers by taking such a leadership position. To date, the data scientist insists that their proposal was accurate and nobody has any data that says otherwise.

If by some extraordinary result the PC workers manage to befriend any of these thoroughly anti-social characters they will be rewarded with a commensurate degree of file system access that they shouldn't have.

### 5.1.5 Nile, Second Floor  ("The Shrine of Evil Chaos")

The third level of Nile is the smallest with a short corridor separating the senior management of the company, being Vice-President, Corporate, the Vice-President, Finance, and the President of the Company. Each room affords impressive views of Wellington harbour and is lavishly furnished with various items from rare woods from around the globe, elephant leg wastebaskets, mounted heads of Darwin's Fox, Iberian Lynx, Ethiopan Wolf etc. A successful Knowledge (science) check with a TN of 7 or a Knowledge (general) with a TN of 11, will lead to recognising these creatures as being the most critically endangered carnivores on Earth (well, assuming we don't know of any *alien* carnivores). 

In addition to furnishings, locked desk drawers of corporate secrets, a computer system (all with terrible password security, e.g., family dog, mother's maiden name, favourite sports team), each room has a small safe consisting of $50,000 in cash (VP Corporate), $100,000 (VP Finance and President). In addition the VP Corporate has the contract of employment with Leoland Border. The other senior executives know about the contract, but it is the VP Corporate who has the truly incriminating evidence. Of note the truly obsessive quantity of cat paintings, statues etc in the President's office.

Most of the time the senior executives aren't actually in the office. They're either at conferences, meeting other senior executives over long lunches, and generally making important decisions based on the advice of those who do the actual work. None of them actually come from New Zealand either. Neil Hotep is Anglo-Egyptian, Victoria Lake is from the United Kingdom (Kent in particular), and Fey Rowe is from the United States (New York). All come from stunningly wealthy families and have the salary and connections to prove it.

## 5.2 Scenario: Palaces of the Electrum Princess

### 5.2.1 Introduction 

"Years ago the valley was green, and animals ran free through golden fields of grain", or so the story goes.

The princess Venice Novateló ruled over these peaceful campsites and the people were secure and happy. They were happy campers. She wasn't a real princess, but that didn't matter because this is a postmodern story.

Then one day a real-estate developer driving a red Maserati appeared in the driveway of the princess' little bed and breakfast and almost overnight the campsites fell into development.

They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot. Now there's only pink hotels, serviced by big yellow taxis. Plenty of rumors remain, and what legends there are tell of a fabulous dreamcatcher is somewhere within the Palaces of the Electrum Princess.

*The Palaces of the Electrum Princess* is a scenario for low to mid level PC Workers.

**Plot Introduction**

In the Palace of the Electrum Princess, the PC workers are induced to a high-stakes game of real-estate subterfuge. Starting in any of the hotels according to the Boss's choosing, the PC workers have just completed yet another mind-numbing corporate training session on team-building and are having a couple of post-work drinks before the long-weekend, when they are approached by an older woman who is well-dressed in a style of clothes that belongs in the late 1960s, but obviously distressed. Asking for the PCs leave to sit, she tells a sorrowful tale, introducting herself as Ms. Florence Novateló, the mother of Venice Novateló. The Boss should select any one of the hotels listed below to start the adventure.

"You must excuse me for prying, but I have done some research on you. You're all very capable people and probably the best we could find for the task at hand. 'We', you ask? Yes, there is a number of us. We used to be the owners of the land here, where we had our commune. We had nature, birds and wild animals, a little stream, and grew mung-beans and sprouts. Unfortunately we have lost that ownership. You see, rather than having the ownership registered through a land title, we used a series of steps so it was ultimately owned by possession of a paper title, registered through Los Republicos dos los Bananes. I know what you're thinking. We wanted to minimise our involvement with our government and the republic had a revolutionary people's government. It seemed like a good idea at the time."

"Anyway, one day one Mr. Sherlock Homes turned up, and decided this was a fine place for his new property development. He apparently had made some inquiries beforehand, and seemed to know exactly what he needed to do. He wooed my daughter, Venice, with stories of wealth and high-society easy-living, and she stole the paper deed. Well, technically it wasn't stolen, because she was a member of the executive council at the time. You see we have annual election for the executive committee of the commune. We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week. But all the decision of that officer have to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting. By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs, but by a two-thirds majority in the case of more... I'm sorry I'm sure you don't need to know these details."

"The practical upshot is that she gave Sherlock Homes the title, and now we're forbidden to even be here (she says, sotto vocce). Venice won'talk to me or any of her old friends and she seems to have taken up an entirely new llfe with Sherlock Homes. She used to be such a lovely little girl. The stories she would tell each morning from her dream-catcher, which she named "Mr. Dreamy". You wouldn't believe her wonderful imagination ... Oh, I'm sorry, I'm going off-track. Business is at hand. We believe that you are of negotiable virtue, so I have brought with me (she pushes over tassel-bag), ten thousand dollars in cash, and another forty thousand when you complete task. We need you to get that paper title back to us."

"Time is of the urgency. We have discovered that Sherlock and Venice have one-way tickets to Los Republicos dos los Bananes for Monday night. Sadly, the Republic is now ruled by Generallismo Casaputa and the friends that we have there are in prison or in hiding. Please, find that deed - and save my daughter."

An easy Sense (Visual) check at this point will indicate that two hotel security guards are having a conversation and are pointing in the direction of the PC workers. If alerted, Ms. Novateló will exclaim, "I have to go, please, save my daughter! Save her!" - and with that she departs quickly, leaving behind the money and with one of the security guards following closely. If the Sense check is failed, or if the PC workers don't alert Ms. Novateló, then one security guard will roughly escort her off the premises. In either case one security guard will question the PCs about their relationship with Ms. Novateló and what she wanted from them. Any plausible excuse will do as they is not paid to investigate, they're just paid to remove people who have been banned from the premises.

**Boss's Introduction**

Most of what Ms. Novateló says is true, but she is woefully uniformed of some of the finer details and, in a way, she is partially to be blame. Venice Novateló was raised in splenid isolation from the rest of society, and was "educated" with the principle that parents should give their children whatever they asked for, because that would show that they truly loved them. As a result, she become a completely spoiled and utterly irresponsible brat. This wasn't so bad in an environment where the greatest damage she could do was take more than her fair-share of goat milk, but when the rapacious Sherlock Homes arrived on the scene circumstances changed dramatically. Sherlock Homes offered her money, new clothes, stardom, and most importantly, hard drugs. All she had to do was hand over a silly piece of paper and not have anything to do with her hippie family ever again, and to that end she readily consented.

These days Venice spends her life in the most superficial and sensual activities. Her day will consist of getting out of a bed in one of the hotels quite late and with some strange but athletic partner from the night before who's name she has already forgotten, going to the beauty salon to get her hair and nails done, and then going out drinking champagne and snorting cocaine at the various clubs at the hotels, which are visited by young dispossessed nobility from Europe, up-and-coming movie stars, young pop stars, predatory aging rock stars etc. There is often a small gaggle of reporters following her around and she is very skilled in manipulating them through scandulous titallation - a review of glossy magazines will show various images where she appears to have a little bit of white powder on her upper lip, or there is just a hint of a nipple showing on a night-club floor due to a minor 'wardrobe failure'. Essentially, she is famous for being famous and is making no worthwhile contribution to existence. 

For their own part, Sherlock Homes, came on to the scene with the single and express desire to make as much money as they possibly could and sought the symbols that they thought represented that wealth and success; a fast car, a slick suit, a big house etc. Sherlock Homes., had previously been a relatively small player in the real-estate world, and whilst they were making a good middle-class income, they weren't heading towards the big time that they desperately desired. One night, hearing the story from a fried hippy of the commune with a paper deed, he saw what was his big break in life (apart from being born in a first-world country as middle-class white male) and, following a modicum of research, took the opportunity to get his hands on the title.

Unfortunately, Sherlock Home's desires to be rich and comfortable did not accord his business acumen. Whilst turning the former lands of the hippy commune into a hotel complex, he simulatenously managed cut corners everywhere and over-invest in the complex at the same time. Whilst plenty of cash flows through his hands, it is flowing out faster than it comes in, and the reality is that Sherlock Homes., is effectively bankrupt. Homes also manages Venice's financial affairs, and whilst her lifestyle choices are expensive to say the least, he manages to make a good amount of underground income on the side by selling adult-entertainment videos of her favourite nocturnal habits via Interenet streaming cameras in her bedroom. Venice is, of course, utterly unaware of this. The reality however is that such adult entertainment can only generate a good income for so long, and Venice is reaching the point of no longer paying her way, so to speak. Whilst not brilliant, Sherlock Homes is not completely stupid. He's done the sums and realised that the writing is on the wall. He's bought two one-way tickets to take himself and Venice to a new life in Los Republicos dos Los Bananes where he hopes to start a new life in the cocaine import-export business. At the very least, Venice will be good for quality tetsing.

The official object of the PC Worker's objective, the paper title deed, is kept in Sherlock Homes's office in a safe, with the two passports, two one-way tickets to Republica dos Los Bananes via a small charter jet, a $100,000 cash, and an equivalent sum of cocaine. A secondary object is Venice's dream-catcher, Mr. Dreamy. When Sherlock Homes, offered Venice more drugs than he thought she could consume, and told her that she had to break off contact with her family, he symbolically broke the dream-catcher into four parts in front of her, and threw them away. But objects such as these have a habit of convincing people to rescue the components from the trash and they are now scattered in different parts of the four hotels. If the PC workers find the four parts, and repair the dream-catcher it will revive a spirit within it. If Venice is confronted with the dream-catcher the spirit will "attack" her, reminding her of the good times of her past life and when she was a better person.

### 5.2.2 Palace Ritz

Derived from the Ritz in Paris this three storey building is in the style of the classical architecture from the reign of Louis XIV and from looks quite beautiful on an initial glance. There is a total of 60 rooms on the second and third floors, whereas the ground floor has a restaurant, swimming pool and gymnasium, a comfortable lobby with adjacent bar, plus the hotel's laundry and administration. There are two cleaning and laundry staff for the hotel, two people who work in administration, three kitchen and waiting staff, two personal trainers in the gymnasium, two people for security and grounds, and a gardener. The administration, laundry, and garden contain nothing of interest for this adventure, although they would have expected levels of security and potential rewards for petty thieves. The rooms are of a modest size, but include all the expected facilities (toilet, shower, TV, Wifi etc). 

Notably, everything about this hotel is fake, a complete façade one may suggest. Superficialy the furnishings appear to be in the style of the Louis XIV period; there are commodes, Mazarin desks, canapés, tables à gibier etc adorning every room. However, a discerning eye will quickly determine these are far from authentic. Where there should be marble, or wood, or really anything of value, there is chipboard and plastic laminate. Where there should be gilding there is yellow paint. Instead of oil paintings there are cheaply framed posters, albeit of the appropriate style. Instead of goose feather and down duvet and pillow filling, there is polyester. There are plastic flowers in the plastic vases. The quill sets on the desks of each room are plastic. In fact, even the walls of the building are made from plastic. At least it is all easy to clean, although if there is ever a fire the place will go up in a toxic fireball.

The restaurant is named "A demain" ("Until Tomorrow") although several of the current and mostly former staff have suggested that this is a mispelling of the phonetically equivalent "A deux mains" ("Using both hands"), referring to the maître d'hôtel's amorous predicilitions. The maître d' himself, Ali Monpourchien (which could be the phonetic "Aliment pour chien", i.e., dog food), is unsurprisingly not actually French or even remotely French, but a rather clever Egyptian who cannot believe his luck in finding a job where he can both pretend to French and can pretend to cook at the same time. In a more unfortunate act of self-delusion he also promotes the myth that the he is the world's greatest lover. Any female character who is even slightly attractive (CHA 12+) will inevitably receive a special visit from the chef, who will expound at length his skill at cooking with none-too-subtle sexual metaphors that invariably conclude with an offer to visit his room to help him make his especially thick and creamy Vichysoise.

The swimming pool and gymnasium is staffed by a French couple, Arnaud "Woody" Dubois and Crystal Château, who look like that they belong from a 1980s home-fitness TV show with their thin bodies, colourful leotards, legwarmers, big hair, and perfect smiles. On the various big-screen TVs throughout there fitness centres there is an endless repeat of stretching exercises with early 80s synthpop. The couple keep a busy schedule for interested guests of personal training, yoga classes, and even jazz ballet. Enrolling in any of these gruelling courses, which torture mind, body, and soul, which require visiting their office which is adorned in various fitness posters of the period, including their personal addition, a signed print of Oliver Newton-John's "Physical". Above this print attached to the wall is a quarter of the Venice's dreamcatcher. If asked they will say that they found it by the swimming pool just as they started working here. They're not particularly attached to it, but if will say they just thought they should keep it (this is the spirit of the dreamcatcher trying to prevent itself from being discarded). Any character who has this part of their dreamcatcher in their possession will dream of running and swimming outdoors, and will gain +1 to skill checks involving such activities.

### 5.2.3 Palace Cliveden

Derived from the Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, this hotel is designed in the style of an Italianate mansion and with a significant estate of very green grass which includes a sizable hedge maze, an English landscaped garden, complete with lake and ducks, and a 9-hole golf course. There is a total of 47 rooms and 15 suites, with ground floor wings which include a restaurant one wing and a truly vast lounge and bar on the other, with the hotel administratrion and smaller lobby located at the central ground floor. 

As with the Palace Ritz, a pretence is made towards authenticity. It is true, for example, that the lounge has Chesterfield lounges and club chairs; anyone sitting on them will soon discover the sticky joy of the vinyl upholstery. The prints of famous hunting paintings are beautifully framed with baroque-styled gold plastic. Many will note that various whiskeys, crockery, foodstuffs etc are "By appointment" complete with crest, and whilst one may immediately think that these refer to products that hold a Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom), they are actually novelty crests referring to the Imperial and Royal Warrant of Appointment of the (former) Austro-Hungarian Empire. There are several animal trophies mounted in the bar and a close inspection will reveal them to be fakes etc.

The staff are a collection of the most unusual parodies of British culture, all in one place. The maître d'hôtel, Peter File, is always deadly serious with a stiff upper lip regardless of how ridiculous the situation he often finds himself in, which is common enough. Peter is well assisted by the far-too jovial accounts and bookings officer (and aspiring author) of ambiguous gender, Paige Turner who will also double as waiting staff on Friday and Saturday nights. The chef, Nick Oleslaw, is a strong believer in the artistic merit of British cuisine, and very much English cuisine in particular (recipes from Wales, Scotland, and Ireland are as close as he will get to "foreign"). "The English have only three vegetables and two of them are cabbage" is the notorious quote by Walter Page and Nick puts in practise with cabbage boiled in milk with suet and offal, cabbage with tripe, cabbage with mushy peas and kidneys etc. Expect to find haggis, jellied eels, stargazy pie, fried chocolate bars etc on the menu. Anyone who is unfamiliar with such far will have to make a test against the STR or suffer a -1 per 2 points of failure for all actions for a day, until the problem is passed (so to speak).

Another colourful character at the Cliveden is the slightly scruffy Major Grimes, a permanent resident. The Major is a former naval officer who, in his late thirties, was an intelligence office on an outfitted fishing trawler that had been converted to a spy ship in the Falklands War. Unfortunately his hearing was damaged during that period due to close encounters with enemy shells, and now he is well and truly retired and effectively living in the bar, where he endlessly drones on about the quality of the scotch and the hush-hush missions that he had to engage in. Phlegmatic to the point of impossible, Major Gimes simply unfazeable regardless of what's going on around him. Which is just as well, as Major Grimes has a cache of unlicensed high-powered firearms stashed in his room. 

Another pair of likely characters are two young groundskeepers, Jack and William Smith, brothers from the North West region. Incorrigible pranksters they have developed increasingly elaborate plans to get a rise out of Major Grimes. This time they think they will actually achieve it on Guy Fawkes Night, which should coincide with the visit of the PC Workers. Responsible for maintenance of the golf course grounds, there will be of course an almighty bonfire on the night. The two brothers will get a golf-cart of fireworks and take them to the green of the 9th hole where they will blast a few shots in the general direction of the Major's room, whilst simultaneously playing Himno Nacional Argentino, the Argentine National Anthem. The combination of events will cause the Major to finally flip and start shooting at what he thinks is a Argentinian hit-squad finally catching up to him for his wartime deeds. For what it is worth, Jack and William also recovered a quarter of the Venice's dreamcatcher, and have mounted it on the 9th hole flagpole. Any character who has this part of their dreamcatcher in their possession will dream of gardens and nature, and will gain +1 to checks against stress or social attacks, as well as +1 for activities requiring fine manual dexterity.

### 5.2.4 Palace Raffles

Derived from the Raffles in Singapore, this hotel has 52 suites on the upper two levels, a small restaurant on each floor, and a shopping centre on the ground floor. The Palace Raffles shopping centre is closest to the main highway connecting the hotel complex to the outside world and as a result has quite a range of non-hotel visitors. The shopping centre has styled itself in the produce and presentation of a south-east Asian market, with the delicious smell of the durian fruit permeating throughout, along with shouts from traders in the hybrid Malay-Hokkein-English language, known as 'Singlish'. The hotel itself is built in a grand colonial Victorian style, with large verandahs circumnavigating the entire building and plenty of tropical trees, vines etc. The ground floor also houses the entrance and administration rooms. An amusing addition to the Palace Raffles is a pair of long tailed Monkey (Macaca fascicularis) imported from the Sacred Monkey Forest in Ubud, Bali. These charming critters will happily take gifts of fruit of various types and also have a penchant for borrowing expensive electronic equipment and glasses. They especially like the facial expressions that humans make when such items are smashed to smithereens.

The several warang-style restaurants in the shopping centre have challened the racist ethnic segregation policy of the Raffles-Jackson plan for Singapore, by mixing Malay, Indian, European, and Chinese cuisines, often all in the same dish, as long as it comes with a hefty supply of fish paste and firey-hot chillies. After all, clearly what was missing from the English porridge was a bit of fish paste, ginger, and curry sauce. Most of the restaurants will serve a meal with palm brandy that'sufficiently potent to be used as an alternative fuel source for their tuk-tuks, and an Indonesian "wine" that is part wine mixed with caramel and ginsing. This concoction is amazingly cheap but requires a two STR checks after consuming per bottle, with a -1 to all skill checks for every point failed due to its amazing capacity to produce inebriation and then shockingly bad hangovers. The recovery is 1 point per hour for inebriation and 1 point per two hours for the hangover. It's *that* bad.

In addition to the restaurants and grocers there are no less than four clothings stores which have a collective quarter of a store dedicated to menswear and no women's clothes that feature pockets. There's two shoe stores, although it is clear that the Imelda Marcos Memorial Temple is certainly winning the contest against the more sports-shoe orientated Wheels of Anuar Manan. Certainly some of the lace-up high-heeled boots would satisfy the former First Lady's reference to "martial law with a smile" (or at the very least a grimace). There are at least three beauty salons for hair, nails, and other critically important service industries, including one (Princess Changping) which has absolutely astronomical prices but actually offers a private service to match. It is here that there is a very high chance that Venice and her entourage can be found. In addition there is a pharmacy (another popular place for Venice to send one of her underlings), a small hardware-cum-cobbler-cum-keycutter, and a newsagent. Every single one of these stores (even the newsagent) engage in the ancient art of haggling. Expressions of violence accusations over price are, of course, simply a cultural misundertanding.

And what would such a shopping centre be without the darling urchins who add a lot of local colour? The scallywags have an astoundingly good variety of techniques to remove a visitor of their possessions including a convincing begging routine of an incurable twisted and broken ankle (+6 Acting skill total), which is actually double-jointed, whilst a pair of colleagues collects what is carried in purses, backpacks, and backpockets (+5 Sleight skill total). As is often the case this gang is controlled by an older businessman who runs a higher-class restaurant, and karaoake bar, one Hung Long, whose has an appropriately reputation (often in *Papers & Paychecks* you may have noticed that NPCs do match their name because the universe is an aesthetic place). The winner of karaoke night (as voted by the patrons) gets to choose and item of their selection from a pile of accumulated goods which were not valuable enough to make to the black market. Among the imitation designer watches and the like is garish mixed-media painting which includes another quarter part of the fabled dreamcatcher. Possession of this portion of the dreamcatcher will generate vivid dreams of international cuisine, generating a +1 bonus to cooking and a +2 STR bonus of protection of any sort of poisoning.

### 5.2.5 Palace Beverly Hills 

Derived from the Beverly Hills Hotel, of Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California, this hotel has 75 suites, and 8 bungalows. It is the pride and joy of the establishment and as a result charges commensurate prices. With a style that is not-quite art deco with various pastel pink and light greens throughout the entire complex (looking rather like the after-effects of too much pink spumante mixed with a spinach and riccotta pie), and not-quite functionalist 1960s functionalism, and not-quite Disneyland, the Palace Beverly Hills somehow succeeds in generating a nauseating combination of the worst all three. Nevertheless, there is an impressive entrance with a extensive lobby and semi-covered dining area which backs onto a wading pools whose water often curiously matches the colour-scheme of the building. Matching the style the furnishings throughout the hotel are the finest cane and ratten, especially the roofs of the bungalows which can generate an authentic feeling of being in a Pacific Island storm if the weather assists.

Palace Beverly Hills is three stories high, with thirty room on the second and third floors and fifteen on the ground floor which also hosts the lobby, bar, and restaurant. Beyond the dining area, swimming pools, and bungalows is a sprawling golf course with so many electric carts scooting about that one would be forgiven the prime purpose of golf is to hit a ball and go for a walk. This said, many of the people at Palace Beverly Hills require such vehicles. Whether it is simply a matter of genetics, bad diet, or lack of exercise, the proportion of people who fall into the obese scale of the BMI is close to one hundred percent. Actually anyone staying here will soon find out that the local restaurant, "Lard Have Mercy", is a contributing factor. Here the historical food pyramid is inverted, so refined sugars, corn syrup, trans-unsaturated fats, etc provide a foundation which works its way up to minimal provision of vegetables, salads, and fruit. 

As an alternative meal on Sundays there is also a church, "Solomon's Temple" where one can possibly receive the most nutritious meal of the week - loaves and fishes. Whilst only of a modest size, is certainly fulfills the spiritual needs of the community by making themselves feel good about their (obviously) god-blessed fortunes. A hefty donation is requisite, as Rev. Telly Vangelist needs a new private jet. After all, how is he going to travel to those poor people in the Pacific islands and spread the good word? The Reverend Telly of course has their own secret and is always on the lookout for handsome young men to join him on these journeys where he can fulfil his sense of charity - "it is better to give than to receive". Training for such exotic journeys are often carried out in the Telly's bunga-bungalow, where another part of Mr. Dreamy can be found, among various cultural items of the Pacific. Possession of this portion of the dreamcatcher will generate serene dreams of travel to Pacific islands, generating a +1 bonus to Wisdom.

The only people found at the Palace Beverly Hills who don't fall into the WASP stereotype are the workers. The olive-skinned chef, Jim Balaya, is of Creole Louisiana background, and speaks English, French, and Spanish fluently. He is also surprisingly thin, given the food that he cooks and the reason for this is quite simple - he never eats a meal. Certainly he snacks all day on whatever is being prepared, but no-one has ever seen him sit down and eat a meal. Whilst one may assume that his grazing activities are sufficient what is unknown to almost all is that Jim keeps a secret stash of fresh fruit and vegetables in the restaurant's walk-in fridge, which he eats when nobody is looking. As much as he loves providing mountains of foie gras, the fluffiest white bread, dishes constructed out of chicken and pork fat, impossibly sweet pastries, and so forth, he is less of a fool that his customers. In fact, he is deliberately trying to kill them; so far four people at the hotel have suffered fatal heart attacks. One day a psychologist will discover that Jim's impoverished (and often hungry) childhood has led him to a position where he derives pleasure from watching the people that he despises most die from the culinary pleasure that he can provide them. This is in part inspired by the whisperings of "Cheesecake", the feminine fridge with a Fieldmarshall personality, who shares this extreme disdain for the well-to-do. Why 'Cheesecake'? Because everyone knows that revenge is a sweet dish best served cold.

### 5.2.6 Homes' and Noveteló's Maison 

Positioned between the hotels but ringed by a strip of woodland, the private home of Sherlock Homes and Venice Novateló is both secluded and prominent. The two-storey building itself is solidly-made (probably the only solid building on the estate) and the interior looks like a display home; well-appointed, perfectly clean, everything its place, and lacking any sort of personal character whatsoever. One notable characteristic is the complete lack of books in the house, with the exeption of a large collection of Readers' Digest Condensed Books which are located behind an office desk on the first level - they have nice binding and look good in photographs. On the first level is an entrance hall, dining room, lounge room, entertainent area, games room (with pool table), office, and kitchen. The upstairs consists of four vast bedrooms, two for Sherlock and Venice (of course they have separate rooms), two for guests, and various restroom and shower facilities. Naturally enough they don't do their own laundry.

On the early Monday evening Sherlock and Venice are hosting a cocktail party, although unbeknowst to the guests this is their final hurrah before driving to the airport to leave the country for good. It is possible for a character to receive an invitation to the party through any one of the named characters (except Florence, Jack, and William) in this scenario, all of whom will be in attendance, along with the deputy mayor, a representative of the Senator's office, and several other major criminal figures. It won't be an enormous gathering, about twenty in all, but certainly with plenty of opportunities to snoop around.

If confronted with a *repaired* version of Mr. Dreamy, Venice Novateló will immediately undergo a psychic attack from the dreamcatcher, with situational modifiers. Presented among a number of the guests, Venice will receive a bonus of +3 to defend, because the social embarassement of being affected by a past she has publically rejected is so strong. If presented to her in private the difference is +0. If presented to her in private and the person or persons delivering the item leave the room for her to reflect, her psychic defense is reduced by -2. If Mr. Dreamy successfully reduces her psychic hit points to zero (bruising attacks) Venice will have a major turning point in her life, taking the Title Deed (if the PC Workers haven't done so already) and escaping the clutches of Sherlock Homes. She might even need the PC Workers to help make good her escape.

## 5.3 The Administrator of Camp 22

"The Department of Immigration will deport a North Korean-born refugee despite recognising he would probably be executed or sent to a forced labour camp on arrival in his birth country... documents obtained by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald show, even though the department accepted the man, Choe*, may be subject to the death penalty, or put into one of the secretive regime’s notorious forced labour camps on his return, these threats are not an “insurmountable” hardship sufficient to stop his deportation."
-- Execution not 'insurmountable' hardship, immigration department says, The Age, 28 December 2018

### 5.3.1 Introduction

Part story, part game, this is an article with a difference - one in which YOU become the hero!

Armed with two dice, a pencil and eraser, you can set off on a perilous quest to find the Camp Administrator's Records. YOU will need to decide which route to follow, and which guards to fight in the elaborate *cough* combat system given in the article.

You may not survive your first journey. But with experience, skill and luck, each fresh attempt should bring you nearer to your goal.

### 5.3.2 Your Character, Rim Song-il

YOU are Rim Song-il, a North Korean prisoner in Hoeryong concentration camp, also known as *Kwalliso* (penal labour colony) No. 22, where you work as a farm worker. You're not to sure exactly why you're here, in fact you can't remember much of your past life. You recall you used to work in an office, and your skills in reading, writing, even using a computer, have not left you. But you do remember being taken away one morning and for an unknown period of time being afterwards being left in a dark room, except for periodic scraps of food, and regular beatings. You do, fortunately, remember your name.

Finally, one day, you were taken out to the farm, where you have worked for what must be a year, at least if the chalked calculations you make each sunset are accurate. By your estimations it is now spring, and the potatoes will be ready for harvesting.

### 5.3.3 The Box

For a few days you have been detained in the dark of a small solitary cell, where there is just enough room to sit, but not to stand or lie down. You start off the story having suffered the equivalent of 3 attacks from a STR 12 (+1) opponent, represent the various cramps from not being able to stretch, along with 6 mental attacks from a WIS 10 opponent, representing the assault om the mind that being constrained in such a manner causes.

Note that you can die or go insane from these physical and mental bruises. If this is so, it is game over. Whilst improbable when you are starting the adventure, you may find that the accumulated bruises have taken their toll. If you have been beaten unconscious on your return to The Box, you will start this section again barely conscious with an accumulated 8 bruises - one more and your unconscious again.

Finally, you have been let out. Squinting in the sunlight, you are motioned towards a Sungri-58 truck by a guard, where you can see several other prisoners that have been bundled in. What do you do?

Ask the guard why you were in solitary confinement? Go to 5.3.7 The Box Guard
Join the other prisoners without saying anything? Go to 5.3.10 The Truck Journey

### 5.3.4 The Gun Fight

You have ended up in a gun fight with four trained guards. What were you thinking? They have Firearms +2, Gymnastics +2, STR 11, +0 and DEX 13, +1 ; you have default skills at -4 and DEX +1. Standard handguns from the core rules are used, causing 3x Wounds damage.  The Guards will continue shooting at you until you are dead. Finally, you are at one with Kim Il-sung, the Eternal President of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Game over.

If, by an extraordinary success of lucky dice rolls, "wonsung-ido namueseo tteoreojinda" ("even monkeys fall from trees"), or the judicious use of Player Points, you succeed in the gun fight, you may make your escape. Go tp 5.3.16, The Great Escape.

### 5.3.5 The Farm

You're back at the farm, in barracks accomodation, with a hard bed and a thin blanket. Maybe you've managed to sneak some chicken meat in, maybe you've even managed a pistol. You try think back, before being put in the box, what work at the farm was like. Your memory is blurry. You remember meals, twice a day, mainly corn meal. You remember the work being very hard and the hours long, with constant exposure to the elements. Any meat you had was from animals - rats, insects, lizards - that you caught in the field. The lizards were the best; how wonderful it was for the Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-un, to provide such bounty!

A child cries out somewhere in the darkness. Entire families are often incarcerated here, "guilt by association". Why are you here? You still do not know, and when you asked the guard at the box beat you. 

But you have a choice, you always have a choice. If you decide to stay here at the farm go to 5.3.11 A Work Day. If you decide that you're going to escape go to 5.3.17 The Latrines.

### 5.3.6 Chinese Border Gate

It takes over an hour to get to the Chinese Border Gate.  There are two guardhouses here, one inner guardhouse that is parallel to what you know is an electric fence, and one outer guardhouse, parallel to a barbed wire fence. In the daytime, each guardhouse will have eight guards with assault rifles stationed, and at night, there will be four. The guardhouses are sufficiently close that all guards will engage in a combat if you attempt to escape or, if you have a gun, engage in combat. Well, you could fight them your fists. But you know the saying: "Looks like you're brought your fists to a gun fight".

The Guards have STR 12 (+1), DEX 12 (+1), firearms +2. They will fire the assault rifles in semi-automatic mode (three shots, -1 to skill). An assault rifle requires a reloading action after 30 round, does 4x damage. The Guards will shot to kill and if they succeed in doing so, go to 5.3.8 Juche Mercy. If by some miracle, you succeed in defeating the Guards go to 5.3.12 The Chinese Border.

### 5.3.7 The Box Guard

With a bestial snarl the Box Guard calls you "kotjebi!" ('vagrant child!', literally 'flowering swallow') raises his truncheon and hits you! The Guard has a STR of 12 (+1) and training in melee of +2. The Box Guard will be attacking with a Damaging Attack (+1x) with a truncheon (x1x), for double damage and half defense. If you adopt a defensive stance (no attack, x1.5 defense), the Guard will carry out 1d6/2 attacks before getting bored with hitting you. If you are unconscious after this, go to 5.3.3 The Box. If you are still conscious go to 5.3.10 The Truck Journey. 

If you adopt any other stance apart from defensive, remember that you will be at (x0.5) damage because you are using fists. If you're very lucky and win the fight, go to 5.3.16 The Great Escape. Otherwise the Guard will beat you until you are unconscious; go to 5.3.3 The Box.

### 5.3.8 Juche Mercy

You are executed. Finally, you are at one with Kim Il-sung, the Eternal President of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the world's only necrocracy. Game over.

### 5.3.9 Inside Knowledge

You have made it into an administration building. If it is daytime and there were any administrative staff, you have managed to avoid them as you make your way into a small room for document processing. There is a collection of desks, filing cabinets, and even a few desktop computers, all lined up in neat rows. You start to look over the paper work, the files describing the various crimes of the estimated fifty thousand people in the camp, and the records of the thousand guards and other staff.

You get an eerie feeling that you should look up one of the computers. It is almost as if it is calling you. Sitting down, and placing your finger to the keyboard, your brain recalls pathways that you have consciously forgotten. You start to type, searching for your own name. Make a Craft (computing) check, TN 9.

If you fail, you find records that you have been incarcerated here for a year and have been assigned to the farming sector. There is not much useful information. You have to leave quickly, as there will be Guards looking for you. Go to 5.3.14 Hoeryong City Gate. If you succeed, go to 5.3.24 Revelations.

### 5.3.10 The Truck Journey

Bundled into the back of the Sungri-58 truck the vehicle makes its way down the narrow and poorly maintained road on the way to the farm. Returning from the Farm a similar vehicle approaches. Make a Craft (structural) or Pilot (car) TN 9 check. If you succeed you have braced yourself by either recognising the effects of the narrowness of road and the pot-holes or you down a quick mental check on the trajectory of the two vehicles. If you fail, you take the full force of the trucks crashing into one another, and experience the equivalent of a STR 15 (+2), mellee attack (+2) with bludgeoning damage. The success of the Craft or Pilot roll adds a bonus to the DEX roll made in resistance to the "attack".

The truck that has collided with yours is full of cages of chickens. The two trucks are written off, both drivers are apparently unconcious. Your fellow travellers in the prison vehicle are making different choices. Some are staying behing to help the drivers. Others are taking the opportunity to steal the remains of a dead chicken (fresh meat!). Others are taking the opportunity to escape. Which one are you going to choose?

Make a great escape? Go 5.3.16 The Great Escape
Help one of the drivers? Go to 5.3.21 Unconscious Drivers
Collect some chicken? Go to 5.3.25 ChickenQuest

### 5.3.11 A Work Day

You are awakened before dawn by the Guards. They shove a small cup with a mix of watery weevil-infested half-cooked rice and potatoes with a little bit of some grassy substance. That will be your meal until sunset. The generosity of the Democratic People's Republic knows no bounds!

You make your way out to the potato fields, where you will spend the day digging for the harvest, placing the potatoes into sacks, and carrying them to the trucks. It is back-breaking manual work, with no respite, and always under the watch of the guards. Entire families, with various levels of malnutrition, work alongside you, gloriously making a contribution to a better tomorrow whilst also being rehabilitated from their erroneous thoughts (some in advance of even having them).

An Athletics (stamina) check is required with a TN of 7. If you fail, you are beaten by a Guard with a club. The Guard has a STR of 12 (+1) and training in melee of +2. The Guard will only hit you once to get you to your feet, but you will still take damage. As you are hit, make a Craft (writing) check with a TN of 9. If you succeed, go to 5.3.30 Subversive Thoughts and then return back to the farm lodgings, 5.3.5. If you succeed in your Athletics (stamina) check you work through the day, exhausted but relatively unharmed, and are taken back to your lodgings, 5.3.5.

### 5.3.12 The Chinese Border

It's three hours travel from Camp 22 to the Chinese border, through farmlands and around the township of Sechon, Hakpo, and then across the Tumen River which is shallow and narrow, however the border is patrolled on the Korean side. Whether daytime or nighttime you will have four Guards with assault rifles to avoid. You have no skill at sneaking , so you operate at a default level (-4) with a bonus (+1) due to your size. If you are attempting the action at night, you also receive an additional +4 bonus due to the lack of lighting, plus you have a environment modifier (+2).

Unfortunately, you are engaging in a contest against Guards who are, unsurprisingly, good at Guarding. You must succeed a contest against all the Guards' Sense (sight) checks; they have a PER of 12, (+1) and a Sense (sight) of +2. If they spot you they have STR 12 (+1), DEX 12 (+1), firearms +2. They will fire the assault rifles in semi-automatic mode (three shots, -1 to skill). An assault rifle requires a reloading action after 30 round, does 4x damage. The Guards will shot to kill and if they succeed in doing so, go to 5.3.8 Juche Mercy. 

If you succeed in sneaking past the Guards you must also make a Swim check. You have no skill at this, so you operate at the default level (-4), plus you are quite weak (-1). However it is a relatively easy crossing so the Target Number is only 5 (whilst strictly speaking this would require a large number of rolls, it is abstracted into a longer-term effect and greater movement). For each failure, take that amount of damage in physical bruises equal to the failure as you begin to drown. You require three successes to cross the river. If you cross the river go to 5.4.23 Illegal Economic Migrant.

### 5.3.13 Steal a Car!

You've managed to steal a car! Fortunately the keys are in the ignition. Make a Pilot (car) test, TN 7. If you succeed, you can drive *very fast* through the Hoeryong City Gate and only experience one round of gunfire per soldier. That'still a lot of bullets, but you have a chance. The car has 8 points of armour and a STR of 50. Return to 5.3.14 Hoeryong City Gate. Those behind the car will get exhausted, but those in front will have to run very fast.

### 5.3.14 Hoeryong City Gate

It takes over an hour to get to the Hoeryong City Gate. Just before the Gate however there is a collection of administration buildings. If you arrive here during the daytime there are eight guards here at each building, all with assault rifles. If you arrive at nighttime, there are four. In both cases there is a vehicle as well. The option exists to try investigating one of the buildings. If you do so, go to 5.3.42 Administration Buildings.

If not, you make the effort to skirt around the buildings and remain out of eyesight. Eventually you can approach the gate itself. There are two guardhouses, one inner guardhouse that is parallel to what you know is an electric fence, and one outer guardhouse, parallel to a barbed wire fence. In the daytime, each guardhouse will have eight guards with assault rifles stationed, and at night, there will be four. The guardhouses are sufficiently close that all guards will engage in a combat if you attempt to escape or, if you have a gun, engage in combat.

The Guards have STR 12 (+1), DEX 12 (+1), firearms +2. They will fire the assault rifles in semi-automatic mode (three shots, -1 to skill). An assault rifle requires a reloading action after 30 round, does 4x damage. The Guards will shot to kill and if they succeed in doing so, go to 5.3.8 Juche Mercy. If by some miracle, you succeed in defeating the Guards go to 5.3.18 Hoeryong City.

### 5.3.15 Subversive Thoughts

Is the first time here? If so, as the Guard's club slams into you, reminding you to get back on your feet and work, a thought comes unbidden to your memory:

> When the people are being beaten with a stick, they are not much happier if it is called "the People's Stick".   
> -- Mikhail Bakunin, Statism and Anarchy, 1873

Where did you get such ideas from? What sort of monster are you? 

Return to 5.3.5 The Farm for another day's cycle.

If you've been here before, different sayings come to mind.

> A truncheon is a weapon with a worker at both ends.

That one doesn't quite seem right. After all, somebody is hitting someone else.

Return to 5.3.5 The Farm for another day's cycle.

> Comrades, you must all analyse your own responsibility. If you have to shit, shit! If you have to fart, fart! You will feel much better for it.
> -- Mao Zedong, Speech At The Lushan Conference (23 July 1959)

You wonder if the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea analyse their own responsibility, or if they think that they everything they decide is fragrant.

Return to 5.3.5 The Farm for another day's cycle.

> Citizens shall have freedom of speech, press, assembly, demonstration, and association. The state shall guarantee conditions for the free activities of democratic political parties and social organizations.   
> --- Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (April 2009), Article 67, Chapter VII

You suffer an attack of cognitive dissonance, WIS 17 (+3), receiving mental bruises.

Return to 5.3.5 The Farm for another day's cycle.

> The basis of the Juche Idea is that man is the master of all things and the decisive factor in everything.
> -- Kim Il-sung, On Juche in Our Revolution vol. 2 (1977)

After attempting the same process several times in a row, you reconsider your irrational optimism. Return to 5.3.5 The Farm for another day's cycle and make an escape attempt.

### 5.3.16 The Great Escape

Which way will you go? It depends on whether you make a Knowledge (general) check, TN 9. If you succeed, you may choose. Otherwise you have to select randomly, by rolling 1d6

1. If you fail your Knowledge (general) check, and roll a '1', you stand around confused and then attempt to run in one direction, then backtrack to another, then turn back again. Eventually you are caught again. Go to 5.3.3 The Box.
2. South. If you fail your Knowledge (general) check, and roll a '2', you head in this direction whether you want to or not! If you succeed your Knowledge (general) check, you know this leads to the gate that has a road which leads to Hoeryong city, and may choose to go in this direction. Go to 5.3.14 Hoeryong City Gate.
3. North. If you fail your Knowledge (general) check, and roll a '3', you head in this direction whether you want to or not! If you succeed your Knowledge (general) check, you know this leads to the gate that has a road which leads to the Chinese border, and may choose to go in this direction. Go to 5.3.6 Chinese Border Gate. 
4. West. If you fail your Knowledge (general) check, and roll a '4', you head in this direction whether you want to or not! If you succeed your Knowledge (general) check, you know this leads to the Tumen River, which forms the border with China, and may choose to go in this direction. Go to 5.3.20 Tumen River Fence.
5. East. If you fail your Knowledge (general) check, and roll a '5', you head in this direction whether you want to or not! If you succeed your Knowledge (general) check, you know this leads to a train station and beyond that mountains, and may choose to go in this direction. 5.3.19 Camp 22 Train Station.
6. If you fail your Knowledge (general) check, and roll a '6', you may select one of the directions of your choosing.

### 5.3.17 The Latrines

Leaving the barracks you make your way to the nearby toilet block that has a barely flickering kerosene lamp. Nearby you can spot the cigarettes of two guards. You know that the guards will be on the lookout for attempted escapes and that they are armed with assault rifles and carry torches. Escape attempts are not uncommon, but success is unheard of.

Without any doubt these worst toilets in the People's Democratic Republc of Korea, but certainly better than any imperialist toilets that might include water, toilet paper, and a semblance of cleanliness. Make a Concentration check (TN 9) to avoid throwing up due to the stench. If you fail take that number of mental bruises. If you succeed, you may attempt to climb over the toilet block wall, as this is your best means and opportunity to escape. Make a Sense (hearing) check, TN 9. If you succeed, you make it over the wall and into the fields. Go to 5.3.16 The Great Escape. If you fail, a Guard has caught you unawares as you're climbing over the wall. Go to 5.3.8 Juche Mercy.

### 5.3.18 Hoeryong City

Several hours later, after climbing through farm, forest, mud, and hills, you have reached the outskirts of Hoeryong City. It is by no means a large city, but one supposes that they can make the right contacts and go into hiding. Make a Knowledge (general) with a TN of 17 as a streetwise check. If you fail, you have made the wrong contacts, and have been turned in by an *Inminban* (neighbourhood watch) informant, who will be rewarded for their service to the People's Democratic Republic. On the other hand, you will experience a different sort of reward. Go to 5.3.8 Juche Mercy.

If you succeed however you are hidden in a cellar for a few days. Your saviours demand 50,000 Chinese Yuan for you to taken to South Korea as a refugee. As an escapee, you have no money. Make a Concentration check, TN 15. If you fail, you are turned in by the people you trusted. Go to 5.3.8 Juche Mercy.

If you succeed however, you remember the address of your family home. A few days later you are told the surprising news that your family has somehow raised the money and paide the people smugglers. They have made arrangements to collect the money and smuggle you across the border, first into China, where you are bundled into a transport truck along with twenty others. After two day's journey in the back of the truck, will be emptied in Ulaanbaatar, where you make your way to the South Korean embassy and apply for refugee status.

Did you make it? Probably not, that is the fate of most refugees. But that's another story to tell. As for now, you have escaped from Camp 22.

### 5.3.19 Camp 22 Train Station

It takes about an hour to get to the Camp 22 Train Station. If you arrive during the day, there is four Guards here, and a truck transporting various goods (farm or mine produce) from the camp. If you arrive during the night, there are two Guards and no train. 

You have no skill at hiding , so you operate at a default level (-4) with a bonus (+1) due to your size. If you are attempting the action at night, you also receive an additional +4 bonus due to the lack of lighting. Unfortunately, you are engaging in a contest against Guards who good at Guarding. You must succeed a contest against all the Guards' Sense (sight) checks; they have a PER of 12, (+1) and a Sense (sight) of +2. 

If they spot you the Guards have STR 12 (+1), DEX 12 (+1), firearms +2. They will fire the assault rifles in semi-automatic mode (three shots, -1 to skill). An assault rifle requires a reloading action after 30 round, does 4x damage. The Guards will shot to kill and if they succeed in doing so, go to 5.3.8 Juche Mercy. 

If you arrived during the night you will have to make two successful hide attemps - one for hiding during the night itself, and one for trying to sneak to the train when it arrives.

If you succeed boarding the train, you can escape to 5.3.33 Hoerying City without having to travel through the countryside. This plot runs on rails.

### 5.3.20 Tumen River Fence.

It takes about an hour to reach the two-part fence. Facing you is an electric fence, then there'some open land and then there's a barbed wire fence. You have no means to get past the electric fence. What were you thinking? 

Four Guards come looking for you. The Guards have STR 12 (+1), DEX 12 (+1), firearms +2. They will fire the assault rifles in semi-automatic mode (three shots, -1 to skill). An assault rifle requires a reloading action after 30 round, does 4x damage. The Guards will shot to kill and if they succeed in doing so, go to 5.3.8 Juche Mercy. 

If you somehow survive and defeat the Guards you can follow the fence around to either 5.3.14 Hoeryong City Gate, 5.3.6 Chinese Border Gate, or 5.3.19 Camp 22 Train Station.

### 5.3.21 Unconscious Drivers

There are two uncounscious driver-guards here following the accident between the prisoner truck and the guard truck. You can undertake one or two actions here; provide first aid and/or steal their pistols and ammunition. If you attempt first aid (an untrained Survival skill), roll with your WIS modifier with a TN of 7, but with a -4 penalty (i.e., 11 or more required). After a few minutes another truck will arrive with eight guards; four will round up escaped prisoners, three will attend to chicken thieves, and one will check on you.

If you are successful you have provided critical first aid, healing them of some of their wounds and preventing death through blood loss. The Guards are impressed with your level of rehabilitated social duty and provide you extra rations. Gain +1 STR and go to 5.3.85 The Farm.

If you are successful and have taken the pistols, roll your Sleight vs their Sense (sight) at 12. If you succeed, the Guards are impressed with your level of rehabilitated social duty, provide you extra rations, and you have two pistols with ammunition. Gain +1 STR and go to 5.3.85 The Farm.

If you are successful and have taken the pistols, but failed your Sleight vs their Sense (sight) contest, you may either fight your way out or surrender. If you choose to fight your way out go to 5.3.4 The Gun Fight, but gain +1x damage on your first shot and the opponent's DEX is effectively 0 (-5 to contest) as you have surprise. If you surrender go to 5.3.8 Juche Mercy.

If you fail the Survival check and did not take the pistols you are taken back to 5.3.3 The Box, unless to succeed at a Act check TN 9 where you give a bawling story of how you struggled to keep the drivers alive. The Guards are impressed with your efforts and provide you extra rations; gain +1 STR and go to 5.3.85 The Farm.

If you fail the Survival check and you took the pistols, roll your Sleight vs their Sense (sight) at 12.  If you succeed, you are taken back to 5.3.3 The Box, but now you have two pistols and ammunition. If you fail your Sleight vs their Sense contest, go to 5.3.4 The Gun Fight.

### 5.3.22 Administration Buildings

You attemp to sneak up one of the administration buildings without being seen. You have no skill at this, so you operate at a default level (-4). Fortunately, you are small (+1). If you are attempting the action at night, you also receive an additional +4 bonus due to the lack of lighting.

Unfortunately, you are engaging in a contest against Guards who are, unsurprisingly, good at Guarding. You must succeed a contest against all the Guards' Sense (sight) checks; they have a PER of 12, (+1) and a Sense (sight) of +2. If you are spotted the Guards, the following Guard statistics also become relevant: STR 12 (+1), DEX 12 (+1), firearms +2. They will fire the assault rifles in semi-automatic mode (three shots, -1 to skill). An assault rifle requires a reloading action after 30 round, does 4x damage. 

The Guards will shot to kill and if they succeed in doing so, go to 5.3.8 Juche Mercy. If by some miracle, you succeed in defeating the Guards go to 5.3.9 Inside Knowledge, or 5.3.13 Steal a Car!

### 5.4.23 Illegal Economic Migrant

Congratulations, you have made it across the border into China. However China does not look kindly upon North Korean refugees, and will not grant you refugee status. You must make contact with friendly Koreans who live on the Chinese side of the border. Make a Knowledge (general) with a TN of 15 as a streetwise check. If you fail, you have made the wrong contacts, and have been turned in to the Chinese authorities. After a couple of days in a Chinese prison, you are returned to Korea where you will receive 5.3.8 Juche Mercy.

If you succeed however you are now working as an illegal farmworker in China and you are provided food and lodging. It isn't much, but it's a lot better than where you were before. One day you may even try to make it to South Korea as a *real* refugee. But that's another story.

### 5.3.24 Revelations

An old memory comes forth and you enter in a password for advanced privileges. Access is granted and once again you search for your name. This time, startling information is received. YOU were the administrator of Camp 22. Yes, it was only in acting role, whilst the usual administrator was on leave for "illness", but nevertheless you were in charge. In charge of those who did the beatings, in charge of those who provided the meagre rations. That was your responsibility.

Apparently, however, you had some moral sense. You had written to one of the many Vice-Presidents about the many "kotjebi" (vagrant children) that were at the camp, whose parents or other family members had died due to various reasons. As they had committed to crime against society themselves, you recommended that they be rehabilitated and integrated to society.

The problem wasn'the suggestion as such, but rather your use of the term "kotjebi", which is forbidden in official correspondence. The order to incarcerate notes that you had engaged in a "bourgeoisie-liberal sentimentalism", "anti-Party propaganda", "destabilising the State and society" and that a harsh regime of "re-education" was necessary. It was the result of this "re-education" that you had forgotten not just the memo, but also your prior position in the camp. If you experienced a beating by The Box Guard, it becomes clear that he wasn't insulting you - but rather telling you the truth.

You suffer a mental attack with a WIS 18 (+4) as a result of this revealation. This is a mental wound, not a bruise, and it shakes you in realisation and will take a long time to heal. 

If you are still *compos mentis*, you may make your way to 5.3.14 Hoeryong City Gate, but before you go there is one other thing that comes to mind; make an Administration check, TN 9. If you succeed, you write a short script that deletes the eletronic records and recurses into the online backups. Gain 5 Mental health bruise points back, as you are bouyant with at least some success.

### 5.3.25 ChickenQuest

Fresh meat! Such a fortuitous opportunity cannot be passed up. Kim Il-sung must be looking down on the heavens for you. You take the opportunity, as do others, to hide some fresh chicken meat on your person. Soon, another truckload of guards will appear to take you away to the farm. Roll your Sleight vs their Sense (sight) at 12. If you succeed, you have succeeded and will have chicken tonight; gain a point of STR and go to 5.3.5 The Farm. If you fail, your precious chicken carcass is cruelly wrenched from you, and you're taken back to 5.3.3 The Box.

# Crime and Punishment

"Please, Your Honor," whined Pauper William Nodes, 27, in a London court last week, "don't part me and the rat." The judge looked appraisingly at Nodes' pet rat in a cage on the barristers' table, frowned severely at Nodes. Clearing his throat he then did British Justice: "I sentence you, William Nodes, to six months in prison as an incorrigible rogue. The rat will be sent to a good home."

**Combat Summary**

* Normal attack, normal defense.
* Damaging attack, +1x damage, x0.5 defense.
* Defensive stance, no attack, x1.5 defense. 
* Beserk attack, x1.5 attack, x0.5 defense. 
* Damage reduction, x0.5 attack, -1x damage.

For example physical attacks apply a multiplier depending on the weapon: Fists = 1/2x, clubs, knives = 1x, swords = 2x, handguns = 3x, rifles = 4x. Attack with surprise = +1x. Determine whether the damage is *wounds* or *bruises*. For physical weapons, 'bashing' weapons cause *bruises*, whereas impaling, stabbing, explosive, shredding, burning, eviscerating, and basically anything that gets under the skin, causes wounds.

Three decades ago Will McLean brought us many laughs with the "Papers & Paychecks" illustration in the Dungeon Masters Guide for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. A cursory search will reveal that on more than one occasion the thought has entered the heads of others that "Papers and Paychecks" would make a great roleplaying game.

In 2017 this game became a reality, a 128 page book with artwork from Dan 'Smif' Smith, famous for his illustrations from the GURPS line of books, Randall Munroe's famous XKCD comics, and with a foreword by the first employee of TSR, Tim Kask. In "Papers & Paychecks" the world itself is downright hostile towards the PCs on a metaphysical level, although usually in a manner that is hilarious. 

*Cow-Orkers in the Scary Devil Monastry* is the first supplement for *Papers & Paychecks*, there are new character classes, new equipment, new NPCs, new settings (fantasy, noir), and new scenarios, including "Keep Our Borderlands", "The Palace of the Electrum Princess", and "Camp 22".

“I have to say, this game has some solid mechanics for a game based on a joke”. 
- Dan Davenport

"The simulation office drudgery beneath overlords who in no way understand the jobs of those they command is complete and soul crushing."
