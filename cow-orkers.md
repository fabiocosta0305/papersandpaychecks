1.6 Skills

Hobby: The core rules say that a Hobby "... cannot be used as a replacement for an existing skill or knowledge, and by definition, represents an amateur activity." A character can, however, use an existing skill as replacement for Hobby acquired as part of their background. For example, whilst one cannot have Hobby (English) because there is alread an English skill, a character can use of Hobby skill ranks acquired through childhood and adolescence in Language (English) instead.

Section 1.6, under character class backgrounds where it reads "Perception", this should be "Sense (various)"


1.7 

File system knowledge

provides a +2 bonus for research and perception skill checks in their current place of employment and a +1 bonus in prior places of employment.

2.3 

Tactical Conflict

Tactical conflict is initiated when a character (PC or NPC) declares it as such. Other characters present may make a Perception skill check with a target number of 11 in standard situations

# 1.0 Additional Character Classes

*Papers & Paycheck* can be a very adaptable game system. Whilst the character professions in the core rulebook as designed to be a broad representation of the various jobs found in a workplace, it has been pointed out that there were other professions that don't quite fit the standard workplace environment. Thus, a few more niche professions are offered here for such games.

## 1.1 Sporting Professions

### 1.1.1 The Athlete

Prime Requisite: Strength
Starting Age: 15+1d4
Profession Skills: Athletics (Strength), Athletics (Stamina), Intimidate, Jump, Melee, Swim, Knowledge (General), Profession, Carousing, Sense (various) 

Description: An professional athlete engages in competitive sports which involve strength, endurance, or speed for their livelihood. Like the labourer they are not always known for their intellect, but their physical prowess is unsurpassed, which can make them very popular in some social situations such as the participation in "paired athletics". An athlete is, of course, vary rare in the usual settings of *Papers & Paychecks* but they are not unknown in some contexts or as a past profession. Like labourers, athletes gains points in physical characteristics as their level improves. Athletes have an extremely low base wage, but this is off-set by receiving double their attribute bonus (or penalty is a weedy person decides to be come an athelete) to this wage. The starting age of a athlete with no prior profession is often quite young.

| Level | Wage     | Perks			|
|-------|----------|----------------------------|
| 1	| $700     | +1 Run or +0.25 Swim Move  |
| 2	| $800     | +1 to STR or PER	        |
| 3	| $900     | +2 Physical Hit Points     |
| 4	| $1000    | +1 to STR or DEX           |
| 5	| $1100    | +1 Run or +0.25 Swim Move  |
| 6	| $1150    | +1 to STR or PER           |
| 7	| $1200    | Adoring Fans		|
| 8	| $1250    | Conference Attendance      |
| 9	| $1300    | Team Captain		|
| 10	| $1350    | Superannuation		|

### 1.1.2 Agent

Prime Requisite: Intelligence
Starting Age: 15+3d4
Profession Skills: Act, Administration, Craft (Computing), Craft (writing), Gamble, Insight, Knowledge (Laws), Knowledge (General), Language (various)

Description: A sports agent acts as the legal representative of other sporting professions, making recommendations and negotiating for pay and benefits. As can be expected the often work for a commission of the sporting professionals salary (around 5-10% is typical) and will often have some legal background. The sporting agent is often depicted as being sly although empirical studies backing this conventional wisdom are lacking. This may be because the agent is typically older than the sportsperson, understands the law better, and is more intelligent - all of which results in much better pay that those they represent. In conventional *Papers & Paychecks* games the Agent is probably more commonly encountered than other sporting professionals due to their interactions with the corporate world.

### 1.1.3 Coach

Prime Requisite: Wisdom 
Starting Age: 21+3d4 
Profession Skills: Intimidate, Investigate, Knowledge (General), Concentration, Hobby (Sport), Profession, Sense (Sight), Inspire, plus one of Athletics (Strength)., Athletics (stamina), Firearms., Gymnastics., Missiles., or Ride.

Description: A coach trains athletes. The skills associated with a coach are typically those that the athlete has as well, but the coach doesn't have the same sort of physical prowess, at least not anymore. Coaches are often retired athletes who impart their knowledge on to the young and upcoming. This requires a professional skill that is not unlike teaching, but also the capacity to inspire or, if that fails, intimidate, the athlete into completing their tasks. There is a sense in which coaches live vicariously through their athletes, and then there are those who will are sufficiently unscrupulous that they will set up their athlete to take a fall for success at the bookmakers.

| 10	| $2500    | Superannuation    	|


### 1.1.4 Gymnast or Equestrian

Prime Requisite: Dexterity 
Starting Age: 14+1d4 
Profession Skills: Athletics (Strength)., Athletics (stamina)., Climb., Jump., Gymnastics., Ride., Sleight., Stealth, Sense (Balance)

Description: A gymnast or equestrian are athletes that specialised in bodily movement, whether their own or that of of their mount. Whilst Dexterity is their primary characteristic they will often will have high scores in Strength as well. In addition, the Gymnast also has a Sense (Balance) skill, which typically provides a bonus to the gymnastics skill or its specialisations. With a heavy emphasis on physical skills, gymnasts are trained young and enter professional life younger than any other. It also means that they are the characters most likely to retire young too, as their body gives way.

| Level | Wage     |  Perks			|

| 9	| $2200    | Team Captain		|
| 10	| $2500    | Superannuation    		|

### 1.1.5 Shooter

Prime Requisite: Perception 
Starting Age: 15+1d4
Profession Skills: Athletics (Strength)., Athletics (stamina)., Concentration., Craft (mechanical)., Firearms., Knowledge (general)., Missiles, Sense (various), Sleight.

Description: What would be a favourite character profession in other RPGs is often overlooked in *Papers & Paychecks* due to the lack of obvious oportunities to blow things up at range. This profession incorporates any number of thrown skills, usually incorporated in Athletics (Strength), the use of human-powered missile weapons (e.g., archery), and the use of firearms. Whilst the primary characteristic is PER, often characters will seek a high DEX and STR as well; even a javelin thrower needs to be able to see their target. All this asise, shooters are one active sporting profession which do not seem to attract the attention of many fans, and they probably prefer it that way.

### 1.1.6 Cheerleader

Prime Requisite: Charisma 
Starting Age: 15+1d4 
Profession Skills: Act., Carousing., Inspire., Seduce., Athletics (Strength)., Athletics (stamina)., Jump., Profession., Insight

Description: The fan-contributed character profession that led your author to go down the rabbit-hole of developing an entire set of 'sporting professions'. The cheerleader inspires athletes and fans alike nominally through leading cheers, chants, and song, but more than often through their through their atheletic maneuvers where the sheer beauty in motion often leaves the fans in a bit of a stupor - which curiously is counter-productive to the purpose of actual leading a cheer. When said fans come to, however their determination to cheer is typically enhanced due to the ecstastic experience of the cheer. Cheerleaders have CHA as their primary characteristic, but like other athletes, DEX and STR are of a high priority as well. Note that due to the various athletic maneuvers expected of them, Cheerleaders are one of the most dangerous sporting professions.

## 1.3 Skill Options and Elaborations

**Languages**

> "A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot"   
> "A language is a dialect with an army and navy"   
> -- popularised by Max Weinreich

In the core rules the language skill is treated as a knowledge skill with required specialisations, with the comment "closely related languages will have a close default with each other". There is, however, no rules for this degree of specialisation or the modifications for closely related languages. 

As one of many lapses into a degree of hard-nosed simulationism that is a feature of *Papers & Paychecks* the following can be used to represent the distance from the specific language skill. Note as the quote indicates that there is no hard rule on what constitutes differentiates a dialect and a language, rather they represent a continuum which is abstracted here.

A *dialect* (very high degree of mutual intelligibility, regional differences, status or subculture keywords etc) has a -1 modifier. An example would be Low and High German. When a character learns a language they may optionally select a dialect of that language that they have specialised in.

A *sister* language (substantial degree of mutual intelligibility, but considered separate languages) has a -2 modifier. For example, Afrikaans and Dutch.

A *related* language (medium degree of mutual intelligibility, a branch of the same language family), has a -4 modifier. An example would be French and Spanish, which are both Romance languages. Related languages are grouped as subdivisions of the wider extended language family (e.g., Indo-European would include Indo-Iranian, Germanic, Hellenic, Celtic, Balto-Slavic, Romance, etc)

A *distantly related* language (very low degree of mutual intelligibility, part of the same extended family group), has a -8 modifier. An example would be Spanish and Russian. Extended language families include Sino-Tibetan, Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Japonic, Austronesian)

Between *unrelated* languages (no degree of mutual intelligibility, different language family) linguistic communication is not possible. Try charades. 

Note that depending on the complexity of a language and cultural exposure mutual intelligibility can vary in direction ("asymmetric intelligibility"). For example, For a Dutch speaker, Afrikaans would count as a dialect with a -1 modifier, however for an Afrikaans speaker, Dutch is a sister language with a -2 modifier. This is because Afrikaans has a simpler grammar. Likewise, with a greater exposure, a speaker of Scots understands other dialects of English as a dialect, whereas an American in Scotland may initially find it a sister language with a -2 modifier.

> "The secretar gree’d tae gie me a haund in the airtin o the dreich policie an its pittin intil effect."   
> "The secretary agreed to help me in the direction of the dreary policy and to put it in effect".

The language continuum can also represent temporal changes. For example, Early Modern English (the English of the King James Bible, or Shakespearean English) can be considered a dialect, Middle English (Chaucerian) as a sister language, and Old English (Anglo-Saxon) as a related language.

As an auxillary language, Esperanto is a sister language to all Germanic or Romance languages

The following is a list of the top fifteen languages in the world by total number of speakers (first language and additional) and some major default values.

As a practical implementation of linguistic issues according to the theme of *Papers & Paychecks* the Boss should consider applying issues of mistranslation as often as possible. There is the classic example of the "water sheep" as a transliteration of "hydraulic ram" in Philip K. Dick's "The Galatic Pot Healer" (1969), which received special attention in the "Camp 22" scenario in this publication. Another potential situation is to applying different legal applications in a multi-lingual country, such as the apocaphyl story of the Luxembourg police using German to follow their procedures and French for their legal code. For actual examples, do consider these real-world failures of translation engines and incorporate them into your scenarios.

1. "Fall" and "autumn". In English "fall" and "autumn" refer to a season, the former more common in American English, the latter in Commonwealth English and from Germanic and Latin origins respectively. A problem arises in many translations where documents may deliberate on strategies for "fall prevention" which translate into "autumn prevention" (e.g., in Spanish "prevención de otoño"). PC Workers may be sent on a mission by Occupational Health & Safety to ensure that the office environment is "autumn proof".

2. In the north-western region of Spain the local language is Galacian. In the town of As Pontes they hold an annual rapini festival, a leafy green vegetable, whose name in Galacian is "grelo"; which is also archiac slang in Portuguese for the word "clitoris". In 2015 the town happily advertised the upcoming gastronomic festival of the grelo. Bon appetit!

3. Literal translations rather than idiomatic translations can cause significant problems. They are also the sort of thing which are easily applied when a character just makes their skill roll in a foreign language. For example, the French phrase "Se taper le cul par terre", which is their equivalent of "rolling on the floor laughing". The literal translation is "Banging your arse on the ground".

4. Sometimes this can go the other way as well. The former Australian Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, was well-known for his use of the Australian dialect of English and at one particular ocassion during a speech to a business audience in Tokyo about Australian industrial relations, he remarked: "We're just not interested in playing silly buggers on this issue". This resulted in some shock among the audience as it was later revealed that the translator had converted the speech to "We're just not interested in acting as laughing homosexuals on this issue".

**Passive-Agressive Attack**

*"Fine. See if I care."*

A passive-agrressive action is an indirect attack against another character which appeals to their own sense of intelligence and moral rightness rather than direct opposition. The attacker appears passive, or even wronged, evoking a sense of sympathy, when in reality they are the one's engaging in an attack. 

In *Papers & Paychecks* a passive-aggressive attack is a special maneuver using the Act skill which combines both a mental and social attack on a target. It is a tactical action which pits the Act+CHA skill against the WIS of the defender, plus any mental defenses that they can gather. If the defender fails they take the differnence in Mental Bruises. Further, any characters who witness the passive-aggressive attack will also have match their own WIS against the value of the attack. If they fail, the defender takes half damage in Social Bruises due to the sympathy that the observers have.

However being passive-aggressive does develop some risks. If the attack fails, the defender gains the difference as temporary mental hit points as they develop a sense of strength in recognising this type of attack. Likewise if it fails against observers, they will respond by generating half-value social bruises on the attacker. 

In contemporary society passive-aggressive attacks can be carried out by email or in webforums etc. The particular danger of the latter is observers might notice and inform others in the conversation thread. This provides observers the opportunity for a second defense roll with a +2 bonus. In one-to-one email conversations they are particularly effective especially in the faux formality of an office environment.

## 2.2 More Equipment

*Manual/Website of Pain*: This manual or website is a necessary, long, and critical document that the PC Worker has to read, courtesy of a requirement from their boss. It might be a legal contract, an device operation manual, an OH&S requirements checklist. Regardless, it will take 3 strategic turns to complete. However the grave problem with the manual is that it contains the mystical power of multiple insanity-inducing typographical attacks. In the first strategic turn the manual attacks with an INT of 12 with the the two attacks of poor kerning and a gratious use of Comic Sans, each of which does 1d4 Mental Bruises. In the second strategic turn there are hanging paragraphs and paragraphs of *lorem ipsum* text, which attack wih an INT of 14 and causing 1d6 Mental Brusies each. Finally, in the third strategic turn it is discovered that the document has broken indexing (or dead hyperlinks) and acronyms without elaboration or glossary. These attack with an INT of 16 and cause 1d4 Mental Wounds. *The Manual/Website of Pain* costs $100, either as a specialist book (ENC 1) or as a web-subscription service.

*Potion of Animal Control*: A curious alcoholic beverage, usually of a mid-strength cheap beer or white wine, requires by to be drunk by the "animal". An "animal" in this case being a particularly festive college-aged indvidual. Once consumed the "animal" will effectively have no resistance to the provider of the beverage for 32 rounds for animals of 01-05 CON, half that time for 06-15 CON, and a quarter of that time for CON 16-25, etc. ENC 1, cost $5 (for the drink) + $995 if the the control properties are known.

*Potion of Dragon Control*: Another curious alcoholic beverage, usually a cheap sweet sherry or rot-gut whiskey, requires to be drunk by the "dragon". A "dragon" in this case being a particularly odious mother- or father-in-law. Once consumed the "dragon" will effectively have no resistance to the provider of the beverage for 32 rounds for animals of 01-05 CON, half that time for 06-15 CON, and a quarter of that time for CON 16-25, etc. ENC 1, cost $5 (for the drink) + $995 if the the control properties are known.

*Potion of Fire Breath*: A rarefied commercial chilli sauce with a Scoville rating of some 3 million units, the consumption of even a drop of potion of fire breath will cause a wound per drop consumed and will cause a bruise to anyone the character breathes upon for the next 10 rounds. They will, however, require to make a successful CON roll with a target number of 11 to act each of these round due the excruciating pain that they will be experiencing. ENC 0, cost $20

*Potion of Flying*: From a near-random sample of out-of-date medications a potion of flying is created, or at the very least, the consumer thinks so. A sensible person may think this is dangerous and there is a degree of truth to it. The consumer will have a great sense of euphoria for a strategic turn for characters of CON 06-15, twice that time for characters with CON 01-05, and half that time for characters of CON 16-25, etc. In addition to the euphoria the consumer will experience a high sense of lucidity, which will provide a bonus of +5 to any task that requires intellectual creativity. After the potion of flying wears off however, the character will feel depressed and will have a -5 penalty to such tasks, for twice as long as the original effect of the potion. What goes up, must come down. ENC 0, cost $100

`https://xkcd.com/353/`

*Rod of Dowsing*: An otherwise L-shaped or Y-shaped stick can be used in to locate ground water, oil, precious metals or gems, and even old gravesites. When used by a person who believes in the superstition, they gain a +5 bonus in discovering what they are searching for. When it is subject to scientific observation, it will fail to operate. ENC 1, cost $5000.

*Staff of Striking*: A staff of striking is specialist targetting weapon that especially affects any characters with levels in Labourer or Tradesperson. The bearer of the staff, upon striking the ground, an attracting the attention of members of said classes within hearing range, will provide a bonus of +5 to attempts to influence said characters but only for the purpose of encouraging them to withdraw their labour from their employer. The range, of course, is quite effective in a room with wooden floorboards and a high roof, and is less effective outside on a windy day. Artificial enhancement of the sound and speech is still effective. ENC 2, cost $5000. 

*Vicarious and Vacuous Grimoire*: "Like sands through the hourglass...." This tome provides drama utterly inane and ficticious characters, their relationships, challenges (especially romantic), and intrigues. Whilst utterly bereft of useful information it is also extraordinarily compelling, and any character who so much as reads the first page will have to make a WIS check with a difficulty of 11. If they fail they will spend the next 15 strategic turns doing nothing but reading the story of the Cordroy and Chime families. During this time their INT is reduced by 5, and their CHA by 5 as they insist on trying to tell all and sundry of the tale. Worse still, when completing the book they find there is another volume, which also requires a WIS check to resist purchasing and reading; "It Never Ends". ENC 1, cost $100

*Wand of Lightening*: Through the very strange machinations of the universe, when a wand a lightening is directed at a physical object the weight of that object will reduce by 10% as long as the wand is remains directed and the object is not actually weighed. The wonders of paranormal science! ENC 1, cost $2000.

*Wand of Magic Missiles*: This short black wand has white tips, rather like a classic stage magician's item. When engaging in a social attack, the social barbs used by the attacker have the curious effect of causing double damage, i.e., with a successful attack the social bruises, or even wounds, are doubled. The attacker will look quite foolish of course, pointing a stick at a person in an argument, but they are surprisingly convincing. ENC 1, cost $2000.

*Wand of Curling*: With multiple sticks, the electrical or battery-powered Wand of Curling will provide a bonus to an Acting skill via disguise. ENC of 1, cost of $100.

**Snail mail magic communications** 

by Fred

This magical device can be constructed out of many different types of boxes that vary in size or shape with the single requirement that they all have a slot in them that is big enough for a single envelope/package to pass through. In action this item will allow a player to send another player a wide array of missives or small packages containing anything you desire. However this method of communication is extremely slow compared to email (see other references in players handbook) but can contain physical objects. Snail mail has a mind of its own and there is a table of results each time you mail something. roll percentile dice and consult the following table:

1-5% Your mail never arrives. it has gone into another dimension and will require a arduous quest to potentially locate it
6-20% Your mail arrives, just at the wrong location. Roll percentile again where anything above 10% results in the receiver keeping your mail forever.
21-95% your mail gets to it intended recipient. Roll percentile again to determine condition. Results above 50% and the mail is unharmed. Otherwise divide by 10 and the mail takes that many points of damage rounded down.
96-100% A monstrous creature called the mail-man is summoned who attacks after issuing one of the following the statements “your postage is "insufficient!”, “mishandling mail is a federal offense!”, “overseas letters must be sent via air-mail!" . He is a wild fiend dressed in very short pantaloons wearing a distinctive looking circular hat that is enchanted to protect him from sleet, snow and provides enhanced night vision. He is always armed with a wand of magic missile.

**The Door-to-Door Wandering Monster**

by Fred

This terrible wandering monster will attack you at your home base, camp or even a temporary stopping place if you stand somewhere too long. There are a number of different variations of this beast but the effects are similar. Once approached you must make a save vs intelligence or be ensnarled for 1-12 turns. You make continue to make saves every turn with the of adding an additional temporary +1 cumulatively to your intelligence every turn until you finally save or 12 turns have passed. Varieties include a selection of religious zealots. This variety usually walks or peddles up to you wearing a completely covering jacket and pantaloons (often black) no matter how hot the temperature outside. They can also be wearing what appears to be a black, flat noose tied around their necks. They always travel in groups of at least 2 and will spend the time while you are ensnarled trying to
convert you to their religion. This can include pamphlets that contain information that defies logic or reason.

Another version is salesman. This variety will attempt to pressure you during your ensnarlment to purchase expensive items you don’t need that will frequently not work. Even if you agree to purchase the items they are pushing they will continue to tell you how wonderful the items are and what a great purchase you have made until you save or the time runs out. roll percentile dice to determine what they are selling. 1-10% a magic item that is supposed to clean your home, den, castle, dungeon but usually just breaks during the first use. 11-40% A variety of potions that when applied to your face/hair/body will increase your comliness by +3. This is a usually harmless product but it will do nothing thats promised at all. 41-70% Miraculous food products that you can sell to your friends so they can sell to their friends. This will end up costing you all your accumulated wealth and you will end up with a vault full of food and drink that will taste horrible and provide no more nourishment than eating tree bark. all the while your charisma will drop -6 points and your friends will avoid you and flee on seeing you coming. 71-100% candy. This inisdious product is usually sold by what appears to be children. During your ensnarlement they will tell you tales of woe that will make you feel bad if you don’t give them all your loot. Save versus wisdom or give them whatever coinage you have on you. Also, the candy has an addictive quality, especially the peanut butter patties, that will cause you to seek out further Door-to-Door monsters looking for the children who sell the cookies.

**Marie, a Rug of Mothering**

INT 11 (+0), WIS 18 (+4), CHA 10 (+1), I+2 S+3 F+3 J+2 (Protector)

Appearing as a fine blue and red threaded Belgian worsted wool rug, with some rather nice patterning, Marie forms a very strong emotional attachment towards the owner, in fact, an overwhelming attachment of motherly love. This involves whispering suggestions that they should brush their teeth, comb their hair, eat their vegetables, polish their shoes, and make sure that they have clean underwear before going outside. Any and all potential romantic partners will be treated with disdain with every potential flaw elaborated to their point that further affections down this path will lead to financial calamity and massive social embarrassment. If Marie is constantly ignored they will engage in passive-aggressive attacks with a bonus of +2, but only causing mental damage, rather than the usual mental plus social damage.

As the rug of mothering seems to be a common psychological trope there are regional variants of Marie that can appear as a Persian rug, a shagpile, a hallway runner, tufted, and braided. In one unique variat the rug of mothering even appeared as a doormat, with all that follows. In Japan, a Kyōiku mama takes the form of a tatami and is especially ensuring the educational success of their child. Invariably such a mat ends up in the hand sof a labourer, for narrative reasons.

**Shannon, a Ring of Turning**

INT 13 (+1), WIS 18 (+4), CHA 13 (+1), E+4 S+1 T+1 P+2 (Promoter)

The androgynous Shannon makes the appearance of a plain white gold ring of some obvious value. However, by means of subtle persuasion, as such Things are wont to do, Shannon will passed on one character to the next until they find who expresses a hatred towards same-sex attracted individuals. Through a very gradual process Shannon will "turn" the character. As such homophobia is based on on the internal will of the charactre's own homosexual desires, this is carried out as a series of mental attacks, until they are brought to zero mental hit points as wounds - however in this case they are not incapacitated, but in the contrary, they are cured of their own irrational hatreds and will truly accept their own desires.

> New Study Links Homophobia with Homosexual Arousal   
WASHINGTON -- Psychoanalytic theory holds that homophobia -- the fear, anxiety, anger, discomfort and aversion that some ostensibly heterosexual people hold for gay individuals -- is the result of repressed homosexual urges that the person is either unaware of or denies. A study appearing in the August 1996 issue of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, published by the American Psychological Association (APA), provides new empirical evidence that is consistent with that theory.
https://web.archive.org/web/20040202035152/http://www.apa.org/releases/homophob.html

**Simon, a Djinn and Tonic**

INT 13 (+1), WIS 18 (+4), CHA 13 (+1), I+3 N+2 F+4 J+2 (Counsellor)

A bottle of gin from the Levant, made from juniper berries grown near the Sea of Galilee, truly a fruitful bush miracle. Apart from the usual effects of gin, this special bottle also contains a djinn, named Simon. Because the consumption of gin has a low-loathing of self, and a high-loathing of others, Simon makes themself appear as the character's conscience to reduce their loathing of others. Of course, Simon has a conscience of their own, and it is quite possible that the character is quite justified in their loathing of others; in which case Simon will counsel the character in a manner that can resolve any issues.


# 3.0 More Non-Player Characters

## 3.1 The Pizza Computer by Shaun Hately

From actual experience. Proof positive that some things are *for* us, even if they have a twisted sense of humour.

"Hi, I ordered a pizza online yesterday for delivery at 9.30 last night. It never arrived. My order number is xxxxxxxxxxxx."
"One moment.... your order is scheduled for delivery at 9.30 this evening."
"Yeah. No. I ordered it for delivery for 9.30 last night."
"It's down for delivery this evening."
"I have the e-mail confirming the order in front of me. It says delivery at 9.30pm on 4/1/2018. That was yesterday."
"Let me open it up and have a look... you're right. My apologies. I don't know what happened. This is all automated."
"That's fine. But I'd like a refund."
"You don't just want the delivery this evening?"
"No."
(Bear in mind that I am fasting today which is why I was rather annoyed at my dinner not arriving last night. The food arriving at 9.30 this evening would be taunting me because I would not be allowed to eat it for another 10 or so hours, and I would have been without food for about 30 hours at the time of delivery.)
"All right... Um... it won't let me process a refund because there hasn't actually been a delivery yet, so the computer says there is nothing to refund. Are you sure you don't just want the delivery this evening?"
"No."
"OK... let me try and cancel the order.... it won't let me cancel the order, because it's already been accepted and it's in the queue. You know it really would be a lot easier if you just accepted the delivery this evening."
"No. That's not acceptable to me."
"Yeah, OK... Sorry. I understand. The computer doesn't understand though... let me try this... no... no.... no... sorry... no..."
"Look - I was probably going to order another pizza tomorrow night... can we transfer tonights order to then? Would that be easier?"
"Yes. Yes. Is that OK?"
"Yes, but I'd like a 7.30 delivery."
"No problem... OK.... done. Delivery for 7.30pm 6/1/2018 - you should receive an e-mail confirmation in a moment."
"Great."
"Oh..."
"What?"
"OK, now we have an order for 7.30 tomorrow night. And an order for 9.30 tonight."
"Am I paying for both orders?"
"I don't think so. But if I really understood how this software worked, I probably could have cancelled the order. OK - let me just check... OK. I've cancelled payment on tomorrow's order. And I'm comping it... OK... your pizza tomorrow will be free, so, even if they deliver tonight's pizza, you're only paying for one pizza."
"I really don't want tonight's pizza delivered. I cannot eat it. I want to be in bed before 9.30..."
"Ah... I could change the delivery time until earlier."
"You can change the delivery time? OK... change it until 7.30. I guess I'll stick it in the fridge or something."
"Done... oh... now we have an order at 7.30 tonight. An order at 9.30 tonight. And an order at 7.30 tomorrow night... OK - I can at least cancel... no, that's the order you want. That's the only one I can cancel... would you mind if I got my supervisor?"
"I think I'd really appreciate it if you got your supervisor."
"Hello... yes... I can see what is happening. But the computer isn't letting us do anything about it... OK - do you want tomorrow night's order?"
"Yes."
(By this point, I am craving pizza... yes, I want pizza tomorrow if I couldn't have it yesterday and I can't eat it today.)
"OK... I can issue a refund on your first order later this evening after it's been delivered at 9.30. The 7.30 order tonight and the 7.30 order tomorrow night are both complimentary. And I'll make a note that your next order is also complimentary... I think that's the best we can do."
"So I am getting four free pizzas? Two of which I don't want."
"Yes... sorry... I know this is a bit ridiculous."
"Yeah... don't worry. I know this isn't your fault. And I appreciate you both trying to fix it. And it's a pretty cool story."
"OK... enjoy your pizzas. Well, some of them anyway."

## 3.3 The Telstra Switch

by Marg Lewis

This is another example from actual experiences referring to a person to try to change their home phone plan, but thwarted by a prankster computer that has other ideas.

Me: I’d like to change my home phone plan.
Telstra: Certainly Plan A will provide xyz.
Me: Sounds great, sign me up.
Telstra: What is your address?
Me: Strathlea Rd, Strathlea, 3364.
Telstra: Please hold while I set this up.

25 minutes later...

Telstra:Thank you for waiting. We are unable to provide a home phone to that address.
Me: I am calling from my Telstra home phone at this address.
Telstra: Please hold while I try again.

25 minutes later...

Telstra: Thank you for waiting, we definitely can’t provide a home phone service to that address.
Me: Well I am calling from my Telstra home phone at this address.
Telstra: How long have you had the service?
Me: My grandparents had the phone connected to this address in 1926, my grandmother operated the local telephone exchange from this address until 1968, then we switched over to an automatic exchange 5 km down the road, so my family has had a phone at this address for 92 years.
Telstra: Oh, there must be a problem our end, I’ll get it fixed and call you back. Do you have a mobile number?



# 4.0 Even More Boss and Alternate Settings

## 4.1 So You Want it Darker?

### 4.1.1 Papers & Paychecks in North Korea

Nearly all games of *Papers & Paychecks* are run with a high degree of tongue-in-cheek humour. There is however, a certain body of gamers who prefer their grim characters to face up to the horrors of the world. These are the sort who like to play *Paranoia*, for example, in 'straight' mode, or delight in their *Call of Cthulhu* investigators being driven mad by eldritch horrors from beyond the stars. Recognising that such people exist led us to explore the possibility - what is the most strange, totalitarian, authoritarian, and bureaucratic regime that exists on earth today? Whilst some places may have the dubious honour of winning a single metric among these dimensions, for purposes of consistency across the board, the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea is the winner. As a very unusual change of pace from the standard *Papers & Paychecks* game, 'So, You Want it Darker?' provides a researched account (including anonymous first-hand reports) from a setting that is nevertheless worthy of in-game exploration.


### 4.1.2 Geography

A description of the geography is hopefully a safe and non-controversial starting point. As a country, it is located in the northern half of the Korean peninsula, sharing a land border to the North with the People's Republic of China along the Amnok River, a short border along the Tumen River with Russia in the far north-east, and with the Republic of Korea (South Korea) in the south along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The length of the meandering land border with China is just over 1400km, the border with Russia is less than 20km, and that with South Korea is almost 240km.

To the west is the Yellow Sea and the northern extension, the Korean Bay, which connects to China. To the east is the Sea of Japan. The Yellow Sea and the Korea Bay are off the west coast and the Sea of Japan (known in North Korea as the East Sea of Korea) is off the east coast. There is over 3500 islands off the coast of North Korea, mostly along the western coastlines. The most significant collection is the Pansong Archipelago, which includes the largest island, Sinmi Island, which has an area fo some 50 square kilometres.

Over eighty percent of the country's area is mountainous, but the north and eastern part of North Korea are extremely so with the Hamgyong Range (north-east), Kaema Plateau (north, east), Kangnam (north, central, borders with China) Rangrim Mountains (north, east), T’aebaek Mountains (east to the South Korean border and beyond). The landscape ranges from several hundred metres to the country's highest point, the volcanic Baekdu Mountain, at over 2700m on the border with China.

Coastal plains on the east coast are minimal. On the west however, there is the substantial Pyongyang and Chaeryong plains. The north and eastern mountain ranges act as the source for the major rivers of North Korea which mostly run in a westerly direction. The longest is the Amnok River which runs for almost eight hundred kilometres forming the border with China, where it is known as the Yalu River. The second longest river, the Duman, is unusual insofar eastwards into the Sea of Japan. Although over 520km, it is almost entire unnavigable due to the moutainous terrain. The third longest, at c440km, is the Taedong River who flows NE-SW and runs through the country's capital, Pyongyang.

The climate is temperature and humid continental (Dwb) on the Köppen climate classification scheme in the far north-west third, whereas the rest of the country is classified warm and humid continental (Dwa). There are four distinct seasons, with warm summers and cold and dry winters. A short rainy season in summer is known as chagma, which is short, hot, and humid. The winters are notoriously cold, especially in the moutainous north and east regions. In winter the temperature range in the capital is typically from -3 to -13 degrees C., and in summer from 20 to 29.

Forest covers around 50% of the country, and has decreased substantially in recent decades due to various forms of land-clearing. Approximately 20% of the land is arable, with about 2-3% being used permanently for cropland and pasture. There is significant dispute over the prevalence of wildlife, with some considering the conditions dire, and others claiming a good amount especially in comparison to neighbouring parts of China and South Korea. Recorded mammals include various species of squirrel and chipmunk (e.g., Siberian chipmunk), mice and rats (e.g., Tanezumi rat), pika (e.g., northern pika) and rabbits (e.g., Korean hare, Manchurian hare), hedgehogs, shrews, bats, cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises), carivores (e.g., Eurasian lynx, Korean fox, Eurasian brown bears), and ungulates (e.g., Manchurian sika deer).

### 4.1.3 History and Politics

For much of its history Korea has been politically and culturally unified. It is true that over 2000 years ago the Gojoseon kingdom ruled the northern half of the peninsula, speaking a proto-Korean language known as Ye-Maek, whilst the south was controlled by a confederation of small states known as Jin. Growing out of the northern region was the Kingdom of Goruryeo whose name is cognate with 'Korea', and which lasted for several hundred years. At its height it controlled all of the northern and central part of the peninsula and parts of contemporary China and Russia, along with much of the south. As contemporaries in the far south there was the small Gaya confederacy, which nevertheless lasted some five hundred years, existing between larger Silla kingdom in the south-east and the Baekje kingdom in the south-west and western coastline. Silla absorbed Gaya in 562 CE, and then conquered Baekje in 660CE, despite the military support that Baekje received from Japan. Several years late Silla, with an alliance with the Chinese Tang dynasty, was able to conquer the Goguryeo kingdom as it was it was struggling with a succession conflict. Silla (often referred to Unified Silla) then controlled almost the entire peninsula for some 250 years until 935CE, with the exception of the northern regions of the contempory North Korea, which was under the control of the multi-ethnic Manchurian Balhae kingdom.

In the tenth century CE, a disaffected Silla general formed a short Later Baekje (aka Hubaekje) kingdom in the south-west. At around the same time, a new Goguryeo (aka Hugoguryeo or Taebong) was established in the north and central region. The latter eventually took over Hubaekje (930) and Silla (935), establishing a unified kingdom (or empire) throughout the penisula. This would last for over three hundred years (until 1392). The Hugoguryeo Empire defeated the Liao Empire on multiple occassions leading to the development of a cultural golden age in the 11th century CE with developments in scholarship and printing. Mongol invasions in the 13th century pressed the Hugoguryeo and brought much hardship to the land; eventually they sued for peace to the Great Yuan as a client state. As the Mongol Empire disintegrated and the Ming dynasty emerged the Goryeo court was split between those who supported the Ming and those who supported the Yuan. 

General Yi, who supported the Ming, overthrew the Goryeo dynasty and established the Kingdom of Great Joseon which lasted almost five hundred years, from 1392CE to 1897CE and made Confucianism the state religion. The Joseon period was enormously influential on contemporary Korean culture, establishing norms, language, etc The development of the Hangul alphabetic-syllabic script in the 15th century CE in the court of Sejong the Great could have transformed technological and scientific development, but it was opposed by the literary elite who preferred classical Chinese. In the late fifteenth century CE and sixteenth century CE, there was a series of factional conflicts known as the Korean literati purges, or 'sahwa' between two factions of the ruling scholarship class. In the late sixteenth century CE, with European weapons, the Japanese invaded but were eventually expelled following naval victories (with "turtle ships") and intervention by the Ming Chinese. In the seventeenth century the Manchurians engaged in two invasions forcing Joseon to become a tributary state of the Qing dynasty until 1894. 

In 1894 there was the Donghak Peasant Revolution which resulted in scores, if not hundreds, of thousands of peasants killed by the government and supported by the Qing dynasty. This intervention by the Qing was a breach of the Convention of Tientsin, and led to the Sino-Japanese war, which was decisively won by the Japanese who forced the end of Joseon's vassalage, leading to the short-lived Korean Empire. This lasted less than thirteen years before it was annexed by Japan following their victory in the 1905 Russo-Japanese War. Imperial Japanese rule remained in place until their defeat in 1945 when the country was divided between Soviet and American occupying forces along the 38th parallel (the latitude, almost comically, chosen by two US officers who used a map from *National Geographic* and wanted the capital, Seoul, to be on the U.S. side). The history of North Korea thus begins with the establishment of the Soviet Civil Authority in October 1945 and the Provisional People's Committee for North Korea in February 1946 with Kim Il-sung, an anti-Japanese guerrilla leader, as chair. The Provisional government instituted land reform reduced landlord's claims to the same as other civilians and major industries were nationalised. Whilst achieved without apparent bloodshed, some 400,000 fled to South Korea as refugees. 

With the Republic of Korea declared in the south and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea declared in the north, with both having military leaders, and both claiming to the legitimate government of the peninsula, war was inevitable. Three years later, with over four million deaths (mostly civilians) an armistice and the establishment of a UN-enforced demilitarised zone has ensured an uneasy peace since. The destruction of North Korea was massive, with almost every substantial building destroyed. Nevertheless North Korea recovered rapidly and by 1957 industrial production had recovered to pre-war levels, assisted by Chinese and Soviet aid. An attempt by the pro-Chinese (and Soviet supported) Yan'an faction to remove Kim Il-sung from leadership failed and political opponents to were subject to show trials, imprisonment, and execution. The industrial economy grew with the provision of (often unreliable) electricity to all homes by 1968, primary and secondary education, and a high level of urbanisation. All during this time there was low-level conflicts with the Republic of Korea; two notable incidents include the failed assasination of South Korea's president, Park Chung-hee, and the capture of the U.S. spy-ship, Pueblo. 

During his rule Kim Il-sung developed a cult of personality exceeding that of Stalin, on which it was modelled, and rejected both the Soviet and Chinese models of Marxist state socialism, both of whom reduced their military, financial, and ideological support for the regime. Increasingly developing its own method and ideology, Juche, usually translated as "self-reliance", includes political independence, economic self-reliance, and an independent military. The precursor to Juche was the 'Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System' which are a set of (unsurprisingly) ten principles and sixty-five clauses for governance and behavioural guides for the people of North Korea. They were riginally proposed by Kim Yong-ju, the younger brother of Kim Il-sung, in 1967 and made official by the son of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il in 1974. 

In 1982 these ideas where expressed in an authoritative form as "On the Juche Idea", written by Kim Jong-il. As a explicit depature from Marxist philosophy when concentrates on class conflict as the dynamic of history, Juche sees the primary conflict as human effort against nature, espouses an idealist rather than materialist ontology, and argues that it represents a new era of human thought. From 1997 onwards the official dating system counts Juche years from the year of Kim Il-sung's birth in 1912. Thus 2017 is "Juche 106". One notable effect of the adoption of "self-reliance" is that North Korea's GDP per capita, which had been equal and often slightly higher than that of the South until the mid-1970s, is estimated to be be 4.5% of that of the South ($1800 USD vs $39400 USD), as the latter has traded its way to economic prosperity and has given up military rule in favour of democracy.

Kim Il-sung died in 1994 and was replaced by his son Kim Jong-il as General Secretary of the governing Korean Workers' Party and chair of the National Defense Commission (NDC). Kim Jong-il's seventeen year rule was particularly notable for a major economic crisis and famine in the 1990s, caused by declining foreign aid, loss of trade partners, lack of critical capital equipment, and flooding. The famine, known as The Ardous March, resulted in several hundred thousand deaths by conservative estimates. Politically, in 1998 the the Supreme People's Assembly wrote the president's post out of the constitution and designated Kim Il-sung as the country's "Eternal President". Already recognised as the leader in Juche thought, Kim Jong-il further developed the idea of an independent military to the policy of "Songun", or "army first" in 1998, notably becoming a nuclear weapons power in 2006. The Songun policy was further developmed in the 2000s with the argument that the army represented the leading force of society, which some political historians have observed is another departure from Marxist orthodoxy which argues that this role belongs to the workers (or, in China's case. the peasants). As a historic achievement, of sorts, North Korea's military expenditure reached over 20% of the country's GDP under Kim Jong-il, the highest proportion in the world (the world average is 2.25%). 

As a minor, but successful departure, from Juche thought, a special industrial zone, the Kaesong Industrial Region, was established in 2002 with trade links to China and South Korea. This dovetailed with the "Sunshine Policy" advocated by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung to improve North-South relations and to allow South Korean companies to start projects in the North. The Kaesong Industrial Region however was closed in 2016 folllowing rising military tensions. Another example was the opening of the Mount Kumgang (Diamond Mountain) Tourist Region in 1998 which allowed South Korean and other foreign tourists to visit this part of North Korean territory. However it was closed in 2008 when a South Korean tourist was shot; the North claimed he had entered a military zone. In 2011, after many years of illness, Kim Jong-il died. The regime declared him "Eternal General Secretary" of the WPK and the "Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission", in keeping with the tradition of establishing eternal posts for the dead leaders. This two is a historic achievement of the country, being the world's only necrocracy - officially ruled by the dead, if in name only.

Kim Jong-il was replaced by his younger son Kim Jong-un, who took a usual array of positions heading the political, ideological, and military functions. Kim Jong-il had his uncle Jang Song-thaek executed in 2013, and it is believed that North Korean agents were behind the assassination of the eldest brother of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-nam, in Malayia in 2017. Like his predecessors, Kim Jong-il cultivates a personality cult, with satellite photos revealing in 2012 that a 500m message carved into a hillside in Ryanggang Province, reading, "Long Live General Kim Jong-un, the Shining Sun!". In 2013 a new set of economic measures were introduced which allowed enterprises to engage in a degree of autonomy, wage differentiation by management, improved levels of autonomy and family-harvest collection in the smaller collective farms, expansion of consumer goods, and increased trade with China. A show-case of gleaming modern buildings in 2014 were mockingly dubbed "Pyonghattan" by reporters at the time, expansion of the construction industry continues to this day. Despite some apparent improvements for the urban population, it was estimated by a UN report in 2018 that some 40% of the population, primarily rural, suffer from undernutrition. It is in this context that the future history of North Korea will be written.

### 4.1.4 Culture and Society 

The culture of Korea is described by its language, religion, arts, lifestyle, and norms. differentiated in contemporary times by the division between the Koreas resulting in some unusual, and increasingly unique, cultural expressions in North Korea. Insofar that the shared symbolic (audio and visual) values provide a the representation of cultural values, these are considered first. This section also includes various demographic information about North Korea which provide an adequate description of the everyday life experience of North Koreans.

As a language, Korean and Koreanic language family, is usually considered a contemporary language isolate, with suggestions that it may be part of the proposed Altaic language family is usually rejected, or the proposed Dravido-Korean-Japonic language family to be controversial - although there is simularity in vocabulry and grammar. Playing it safe, many linguistics place Korean in a Paleosiberian language family - a term of convenience to incorporate in a number of language isolates in the region. Within the Koreanic language family in its own right, Modern Korean is the only member with the exception of Jeju, spoken by less than ten thousand people in a island province of the same name south of peninsula. Modern Korean is derived from Middle Korean (from the 10th to 16th century's CE), and in turn from Old Korean (from the 4th to 10th century's CE), with the latter derived from the ancient languages of the peninsula and of southern Manchuria.

Korean is an agglutinative language; affixes are added ("glued") to words to change a word's meaning in a sentence or grammatical position. Sentence endings are also used, to indicate surprise, dispassionate acknowledgement of fact, agreement, rhetorical questions, and voluntary action, to give several common examples. The word order in the Korean language is subject-object-verb e.g., "Chin-Sun japchae eats". The writing style is the aforementioned Chosŏn'gŭl, invented by King Sejong the Great, known in the South as Hangul. The alphabet consists of 40 characters; 19 consonants and 21 vowels. Letters are arranged syllabic blocks and are written left to right (they were traditionally written top to bottom, right to left). An interesting feature of the characters is the correlation between the shape of the letters and the and a representation of the mouth's position when they are pronounced. There are minor differences in lettering between North and South, and several dialects throughout the peninsula. Another minor difference is foreign-language word borrowings; North Korea has more Russian words, whereas South Korea has more English words. Furthermore a selection of Hanja characters (use of Chinese characters in the Korean language) is also taught in North Korean schools and universities.

North Korea is officially an atheist state where estimates suggest that approximately 2/3rds of the population are non-religious. Among those that do follow a religion (apart from Juche, of course) approximately 1 in 7 follow tradition Korean shaminism, 1 in 7 are part of the Chondoism faith ("Religion of the Heavenly Way"), a neo-Confucion religion established in the early 20th century, approximately 1 in 20 are Buddhists, and there is a small number of Christians. Korean shaminism, also known as Muism or Sinism, incorporates ancestor worship, spirits of various scope and power, holistic considerations, and mediation in rituals of sacrifices, dance, song, and prayers, between the gods, the mu (shaman), and worshippers. The mu are ascetics who seek purity of body and man. Chondoism developed from the Donghak ("Eastern Learning") Confucian movement which opposed the encroachement of Western ideas, and carried the secular ideas of poverty alleviation, especially amont the peasants, and political stability. It is recognised by the North Korean government as being revolutionary, anti-imperialist, and is represented in the government through its own political party. The North Korean constitition does include freedom of religion and even the construction of religious buildings, but all within the caveat of protecting the state from foreign powers and ensuring social order. In effect this means that any religious organisation is, at best, closely monitored.

Religion also plays a role in the traditional crafts of North Korea, incorporating elements of historical shamanistic dance rituals, 

Whilst freedom of the press is technically allowed under the constitution, in reality it is strictly controlled. North Korea regularly rates near the bottom of the international assessments conducted by groups such as Reporters Without Borders. Propaganda is pervasive, and news content is heavily orientated (c95%) towards local issues, albeit including the issue of reunification. Foreign affairs or news is rarely mentioned. There are twelve newspapers and twenty periodicals, with the major newspapers being Rodong Sinmun ('Labour Daily', newspaper of the Central Committee of the Worker's Party of Kora), Joson Inmingun (newspaper of Korean People's Army), Minju Choson ('Democratic Korea', the government newspaper), Rodongja Sinmun ('Workers Newspaper', newspaper of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea), and in English and French editions, 'The Pyongyang Times'.

Radio is the most commonly used broadcast media in North Korea. The four North Korean radio networks, the Korean Central Broadcasting Station, which acts as the  the main domestic full service radio network, Pyongyang FM Broadcasting Statio, for domestic music, the Pyongyang Broadcasting Station, an "all-Korea" service primarily aimed at South Koreans and ethnic Koreans in China, and Voice of Korea, a multi-lingual shortwave broadcaster aimed at worldwide audiences. It is illegal for North Koreans to listen to anything other than state-run radio and all radios sold by state shops in North Korea are fix-tuned to government frequencies. Notably North Korea does not jam any commercial South Korean television or radio broadcasts, however some of South Korea's state-owned radio and television broadcasts are subject to jamming. Internet access and mobile phone use is highly restricted, usually available to members of the nomenklatura (party elite). From 2013, foreigners visiting North Korea have been able to use mobile phones with local coverage only.

In North Korea there is one official source of television news, Korean Central Television (KCTV), first established in 1953. It currently broadcasts for eight hours a day on a regular schedule of music, news, documentaries, children's shows, sports, drama, feature films, and curiously situation comedies, including a military comedy called 'It's So Funny', which has been running since the 1970s. Between 2004 and 2005 one particular television show is deserving of special prominance, entitled "Let's trim our hair in accordance with the socialist lifestyle". In addition to this news channels there is the educational channel, Mansudae Television which broadcasts for three hours on Saturdays, and nine hours on Sundays. It was temporarily suspended in 2015 for reasons unknown but then revived. The newest station available is Sport Television.


## 4.2 Fantasy Papers & Paychecks

## 4.3 Boss-Level Secrets

In the core rulebook there is an extensive section for advising The Boss on how to keep player-character workers in line whilst at the same time generating an interesting story of action and adventure. Alas, sometimes The Boss finds themselves being berated and bullied into submission by their players whilst at the same time plot outcomes seem to unreasonably favour the PCs. Well, it is time for you to take back control. It is time for you to be The Boss, with the definite article, and start shouting in German because life is short and terrifying. Shout it! Bist du unterm Pantoffel stehen?! See, you feel better already. Now, let's take back control of the game whilst *pretending* that you haven't and creating an entertaining story tha that players will think is of their own creation. This is *The Secrets of Being The Boss*.

**Maximum Game Joy**

Many suggestion of game play argue for "fun". An example of this is found in *RuneQuest: Roleplaying in Glorantha*. It reads:

```
Maximum Game Fun
When writing, thinking, and gaming in Glorantha, always ask yourself, "Now, in this situation what is the most fun?" and then go with it. That's Maximum Game Fun (MGF). Keep this principle in mind whenever you apply the rules of RuneQuest to any situation.
```

Now one would be thinking that a deliberately comic game like *Papers & Paychecks* would _thoroughly_ endorse this comment. At first blush, it does make a lot of sense with objective of entertainment. But there is a couple of minor modifications to the suggestion, whilst giving it recognition as a worthy contribution. Firstly, it is recognised that the word "fun" comes from the North Germanic noun fon ("foolish, simple, silly") or verb fonnen ("make a fool of"), and in English it first appears in 1680s meaning "to cheat, trick". Now sometimes we do want to play a foolish and silly game; "shits and giggles", as it is often described. But not all the time. 

Perhaps what should be sought is "Maximum Game Joy", which is closer to a happiness from acquisition or experience, bliss, and glee. What's the difference? With "joy" you can have a _player_ experience depths of frustration and sadness, at a particular moment and still come out of the experience with _joy_ - just like a good play or movie does. Think of a player who is so moved by the description of a scene that they are literally in _tears_ (of sadness or happiness). This does not sound like fun, but it certainly is joy.

```
Give them pleasure – the same pleasure they have when they wake up from a nightmare.   
-Alfred Hitchcok, On audiences, Asbury Park NJ Press (13 August 1974).   
```

One other point must be emphasized, and why "joy" is probably a better objective than "fun". "Fun" tends to argue for immediate pleasure in a situation which is short-term, whereas "joy" provides greater opportunity for a delayed, but longer-lasting pleasure from the gaming experience. The sheer frustration of battling Whitechapel the Fatberg may not seem to be much fun at the time, but when it is finally defeated and the secret revealed, a greater and more satisfying pleasure is received. "Joy" can and often should include "fun" especially in a game like *Papers & Paychecks* where the humour can contain slapstick elements. But is not always and not just fun; "joy" is a more encompassing term. So think it terms of what is the most _joy_ you can bring to any situation, and go with it.

**Luck: Rarer than Rocking-Horse Shit**

*Papers & Paychecks* is a game that comes with systemic narrativism. That is, the players have a a metagame value to alter the result of a die-roll according to their volition, and is rewarded to players who make an earnest contribution to the game. In part this is the systemic implementation of what GMs have been doing for years in a subjective manner. After all there's an entire game-system called "FUDGE" (yes, it is an acronym), which was a bit of an in-joke recognition of this problem. GMs for *years* have looked what the dice have rolled and promptly ignored it because it would completely derail a plot, or never even get into the plot, such as in the case of a failed Library Use roll in *Call of Cthulhu*, or it would lead to the sudden, random, and unexpected demise of a favoured PC or NPC. For the most part, as long as the illusion of randomness is maintained, all seems well.

It is important *not* to fudge the dice results in *Papers & Paychecks* in this fashion for two reasons. The first is the aforementioned element of "narrativist" game design where, in part at least, the player gets to direct the story, and often the fate of the character that they are playing. Sometimes this is done for tactical reasons, for example, to save their Luck points for the "big bad" event, person, or thing, at the end of a project. The other reason to avoid fudging dice rolls in *Papers & Paychecks* is that the need to do so has been largely removed by the introduction of Luck points. Adding dice fudges with Luck can lead to a game which is too easy, and that would be contrary to the spirit of the game which really demands that the players are kept on their toes, as their characters barely make it through by the skin of their teeth. By all means do fudge-modify that "hidden from players" die roll when they are making critical perception checks or the equivalent of the library use roll - but also modify their Luck when doing so. 

Further, players should seriously earn their Luck points. Just an overly-generous GM in other games can make things too easy for the players by fudging the dice in their favour more than what is deserved, the same can occur when a Boss in *Papers & Paychecks* is overly-generous with the awarding of Luck points. Remember that Luck points are awarded for particularly impressive contributions during play. Merely turning up doesn't provide one - but not turning up without a valid excuse will result in a penalty. Roleplaying the character doesn't generate Luck - that's expected behaviour. But acting contrary to how the character would act will result in a penalty. Melodramatic and thoroughly entertaining roleplaying will generate a Luck point. Great opportunities for melodramtic roleplaying occur when the dice come up with their maximum or minimum values.

In many ways, Luck is both a carrot and a stick to encourge players to engage in the story in a dramatic fashion. When the Boss awards points it acts as a carrot. Waving around a shiny glass bead that catches the light at the right moment is a great prop. On the other hand the possibility of the Boss taking away a Luck point acts as a very powerful stick. Remember that this is a game where Luck points can go negative - which means that the Boss will favour the world as an antagonist against the player and their characters at the worst possible time. Overall however, there should be sufficient opportunities for players to earn at least a 3-4 Luck points per game session - and certainly at least 4-5 situations where they almost certainly have to spend one to get out of a problem. Review the *Code Of Cthulhu* from the core rulebook to give a particularly strong example of Luck in action. 

Make the the players are actively seeking ways to gain Luck points. Remember that Luck is a *player*  characteristic, not a character characteristic. In a story, the most powerful character is often quite different to the one who is most Lucky, and indeed, the sheer pluck of a weaker charater will often see them through, "audentis Fortuna iuvat" (Turnus, in Virgil's "Aeneid"), "fortune favours the bold", and in *Papers & Paychecks* the player has a mechanism to give a higher degree of truth to that statement than reality would otherwise grant. But of course, not just any player. It is those players that have earned Luck points. It is those who have contributed by their acting, by providing a pleasant venue, to those who arrive on time etc. A character who is powerful but is played by a person who is a disruptive person and is constantly out-of-character will find that fortune does not favour any of their characters.

**The Magical Realism of Monsters**

```
Newt: My mommy always said there were no monsters - no real ones - but there are.   
Ripley: Yes, there are, aren't there?   
Newt: Why do they tell little kids that?   
Ripley: Most of the time it's true.   
-- Aliens (1986)
```

Whilst *Papers & Paychecks* is partially inspired by modern rolepaying games which have supernatural elements (the *Ghostbusters* "frightfully cheerful RPG is particularly noted), it is very important that the Boss ensures that the monsters aren't real, at least in a sense. This may seem counter-intuitive at first. After all, the various sapient monsters in the main rulebook have charactreristics, skills, personality and so forth. In that sense, yes, they can are "real". They are NPCs who will have a direct influence on the environment and PCs. 

In another sense however they are not real. That is, all their activities remain hidden from human perception and recording. All the effects of a monster's behaviour is something that is explicible; the coffee machine gurgles and spurts hot fluid over the final contract that you're about to deliver to a meeting, the pen that leaks just as one purchases an expensive white shirt, and so forth from the trivial nuissance to downright dangerous, the things appear to be have a mind of their own ranging from mischief to malice. 

Under almost no circumstances however, will the monsters reveal themselves, and to a degree they probably can't - their perception is called "Extra Sensory Perception" for a reason. They are, in a sense, "spiritual machines" and created from their presence with humans. With the exception of voice-controlled devices, even communication between monsters and humans takes the appearance of "voices in one's head", and we know how people who make such claims are treated. Of course, exceptions do exist (c.f., Garry the Gazebo) but again such a revelation is stories which no person would believe, and those who claim otherwise would be justly ridiculed.

The literary genre to apply, albeit often in a comic manner in *Papers & Paychecks*, is that of 'magical realism'. Whilst it is common among fictional genres for their to be some furious debate about such terms in this context it follows the expression found in writers like Gabriel García Márquez (_One Hundred Years of Solitude_) and Salman Rushdie (_Midnight's Children_). In these novels, from the protagonist's perspective, the world is certainly magical. But the expression of this magic is subtle, and subjective. From an objective viewer, various events may have a dramatic quality about them, but they are certainly realistic. Keep that spirit in *Papers & Paychecks*.


# 5.0 Alternate Settings and Scenarios

## 5.1 Scenario: Keep Our Borderlands by Michael Cole and Lev Lafayette

### 5.1.1 Background

The realm of independent book publishers is narrow and constricted. Always the forces of corporate publishers press upon its borders seeking to enslave its consumers, rape its riches (WTF, Gary?!), and establish a monopolistic advantage against any future competitors. If it were not for a stout few many in the industry would indeed fall prey to the evil which surrounds them. You are indeed members of that exceptional class, workers, who are in the employ of the independent publisher, Borderlands in search of workplace recognition and a paycheck that is sufficient to cover ever-increasing rents. Of course you are inexperienced but you have your skills and a heart that cries out for a job well done. You have it in you to become great, but you must gain experience and knowledge, greater skill, and then a more senior position with higher pay ("that's what we tell all the new staff"). There is much to learn - receiving letters from would-be authors and their agents, editing poorly-written manuscripts, going through the crank file in desparation, typesetting, dealing with printers, the sound that deadlines make as they whoosh overhead, warehouses, distribution, the always late payments, and the demanding authors for their cut. 

Ahead, up the slight incline, heading towards Cuba mall of Wellington city, looms the great publisher, Borderlands, a stronghold of civilization, between good business practises and bad. Nearby, among the glistening towers of glass and steel, is the Pyramid of Nile, where fell corporate lackeys wait. All of this you know, but before you venture for your day's work, you must become acquantited with your fellow co-workers, all of you recently having achieved the glory of paid employment. For each workday requires cooperation among all to get anything done, even if Wally over there doesn't seem to do anything at all. Now, as you enter the grim entrance of a soul-crushing menial job with little future in a small, family-owned, publishing company, is the time of exchanging meaningless social pleasantries of the workplace, where deep down all do have a sense of some solidarity with each other, knowing the harrowing experiences that confront them in your first workday ahead.

**Notes About Borderlands**

The PC Workers in "Keep Our Borderlands" have just joined a medium-sized family-owned publishing house with some fifty employees.

The whole place is well organised for security and logistics. Despite the description work here is carried out at pace that doesn't damage quality of work. "More haste, less speed" is a proverb that owner Castel Border expresses with the sort of regularity that his wife may one day make a claim for justifiable homicide. It is, indeed, his entire business logic. Eschewing any desire to expand the business, happy with the stable and existing distribution lines for thirty years, using the same printers, the same warehousing company, and many of the same authors. Indeed, there is a mind-numbing sense of sameness about the place. Fortunately, there have bene equipment upgrades, courtesy of the recommendations of the younger son, Leoland Border.

The main non-player characters of Borderlands publishing house are Castel Border, Stellan Border, Leoland Border, and Seneca Philosophus. Castel Border is the silver-haired, pin-striped suit, elderly, cantankerous, and yet quite clever owner of the business. Now in his seventies, he inherited the business from his father and has kept the ship steady, "steady she goes" is yet another of his annoying pearls of wisdom that will be recited several times a day. His two sons are Stellan Border and Leoland Border with the main inheritence of the store almost certainly going to Stellan. Castel has the role of general manager.

Stellan Border is a kindly gentleman in his early fifties who dresses in an unassuming navy suit with fine selection of paisley ties. In many ways he's very much like his father, in terms of disposition and a sense of an unhurried approach, but he is largely lacking in business acumen and has an appaling sense of timing. Throughout the story, is almost certain that he will turn up when the PC workers are busy and then not be able to found when he is needed. Stellan never had an unkind word for anybody, not even his brother, of whom he has suspicions. Stellan is charge of author and agent liaison, where his natural charm shines, and content production, where he can get in the way.

Leoland Border is a pleasant and friendly man in his mid-forties, solid and well-built (he works out at the gym every morning), typically dressed in a very sharp Hackett charcoal black suit, thin-tie and perfect-white shirts. Even remotely astute observers will notice his sense of taste for well-known items that carry a price-tag, including a Rolex watch and a Mont Blanc pen. Always attentive, despite being very busy he will book an appointment for any worker who wishes to see him; "my door is always open" is his annoying platitude. Leoland is in charge of accounts and distribution, as well as improving the technological systems at Borderlands.

Leoland's Hackett suit, Rolex watch, and Mon Blanc pen are actually monsters in league with each other and acting in concert to control Leoland and lead him down his existing path of a desire for power and wealth. All three engage in long-term and subtle mental attacks at appropriate times and have led to a situation where Leoland is actually totally in their control. As a result of his divulgence of business secrets, Leoland is actually secretly working for Nile and receiving a very nice stipend for this gradual activity of corporate espionage that is gradually bringing Borderlands to its knees. The plan is for Nile to eventually take over Borderlands and Leoland will take that top position as manager of a local content branch; Castel will face a lonely retirement somewhere remote in the South Island and Stellan will be driven out of the business. The monsters however have no intention of letting up at this point and will drive Leoland to even more nefarious deeds. 

The three items represent and target Freudian aspects of their personality, the Hackett suit representing Leolan's environmental needs (their id), the Rolex watch reminding them of the control that the external social world has on them (their superego), and the Mont Blanc pen for their introspection and expression (their ego). If separated from his items their power will gradually diminish and Leoland will come to his senses (of sorts). "A holiday", whether in a literal sense such as a few months in Fiji, or in the figuartive sense as in a period in "The Big House" for fraud, would actually do a world of good for Leoland.

Sofia Seneca is a professional and highly-organised woman of an Italian background, who is the very picture of a modern business woman. She will be the main contact and manager of the PC workers, and whilst she has a lot to do (effectively, she is the one that keeps everything working on a day-by-day level), she will always act as a patron to the PC workers. Like Stellan and Leoland, she works directly for Castel. Sofia will provide the PC Workers and introduction to their work, which at least on paper is as varied and appropriate to their profession. She will take the opportunity for daily meetings with the PC Workers to be as helpful as possible. In the course of their various mundane duties (and, my god, are they mundane), the PC Workers will determine, as the facts speak for themselves, that Borderlands is under serious trouble due the introduction of the multinational Nile to their local industry.

If and when a PC Worker raises the matter, Sofia will introduce the PC Workers to a new employment opportunity - infiltrating Nile and engaging in corporate intelligence gathering, reconaissance, and even espionage. This is of course explained out-of-the-office and with sufficient security precautions. A vast room in an abandoned warehouse on the docks is a good location. Sofia will show the PC Workers several appropriate job offers that have come up at Nile, a company whose local office is already five times the size of Borderlands. Glowing references from several defunct companies are provided to ensure the successful applications of the PC Workers. Obviously, while they are employed by Nile they are also working at Borderlands - and what PC Worker would turn down the opportunity for double pay?

## 5.1.2 The Outside

With a clear task before them, the PC Workers will almost certainly want to investigate Nile. The following are availble, apart from the most mundane corporate information on their website, and a surprising number of complaints from consumers unhappy with the customer service of their warehouse direct book sales.

**The Manic Street Preacher (aka The Mad Hermit)**

At a book-signing, reading, or similar event at Borderlands, a character who makes a successful Sense (Sight, Hearing, Smell) roll will notice a rough-looking elderly man standing outside in a dirty overcoat, the tell-tale sign of a bottle in a brown-bag sticking out of his coat pocket, rheumy eyes, a greying and unkempt beard, and a significant odour etc. For all intents and purposes this seems to be one of many unfortunate members of society whom life and the economic system has given a bad hand. However, what is quite different about this individual is that they are parading back and forth with a hand-made sign which states "The End is Nile!". Not only that but the individual also rants about how Nile is seeking to take over every book publisher, every distributor, every bookstore, and then they'll move on to radio, television and even (and especially) the Internet. "And then they will control all the information! And they'll have control of you! And you! And you!", as he points manically at indifferent or worried pedestrians.

When pressed further the Manic Street Preacher will continue on a similar theme, and will start dropping names of ranking employees of Nile and of Borderlands, and indeed seems very familiar with the various operations of Borderlands. If more than two PC Workers start paying him attention however, he will attempt to flee the scene in a dramatic manner making comments about how is being chased by spooks. Following him will eventually lead to his home, such as it is, an a disused lavatory in the cellar of a local council building which, like all such places, is both missing the light and the stairs (the Manic Street Preacher knows the way down). Also on the door of the lavatory is a sign that says "Beware of the Leopard", and they're not kidding either. In this case "Leopard" is a particularly large and savage domestic Savannah cat who dearly loves his human staff and will take advantage of the dark to engage in sneak attacks.

Getting past the Manic Street Preacher and Leopard is quite revealing. Among his scant normal possessions are several old scientific books that were distributed through Borderlands, various old company records from Borderlands, more recent documents from Nile (he's done some dumpster diving), and many scribbled notes about the corporate strategy from Nile and their attempts to take over Borderlands and other media. One will even find a small box containing a few hundred dollars, and a passport which reveals his identity as Alderman Border.

Every family has skeletons in their closet, and some more than others, and Alderman Border is the skeleton for the Border family. Once the brightest and first son of Castel and in charge of their now defunct distribution of academic texts, Alderman could see the threat posed by Nile but lacked the administrative and communicative skills to express his concerns effectively. Seeking solace in bottles of strong alcoholic beverages alternating with serotonergic psychedelics, Alderman became increasingly speculative with his opinions on Nile's intentions. Never a great administrator his work began to slide leading to the collapse of the academic distribution line, which was eagerly taken up by Nile. This simply confirmed his fears and increased his rantings until the day came that Leoland had to forcibly remove him from the building. He still returns at times with his placard to berate and accost anyone who crosses his path and makes eye contact. When there is nobody around Stellan will take him aside to have a quiet word about his diet and hygeine, ask how the cat is, and slip him some money.

**Due Authority (aka The Lizard Men)**

Any half-competent Internet research on Nile and their activities in New Zeland will result in discovering the "Due Authority" website. "Due Authority" is a pro-monarchist, New Zealand nationalist (yes, there is really such a thing), and anti-foreign investment group, whose political opinions stray from the wingnut right to the moonbat left, but never in-between. The following is a good example of one of their posts, concerning any potential to the chage of the New Zealand flag, which inspired the formation of the group.

"Hey, don't mean to to freak y'all out (actually, yes I do!) but there's a lot more to this NZ flag change malarkey than most people realise...

A change of flag means not only that we have taken a major step to removing the DUE AUTHORITY of the crown. It also means we take away the very power which enforces both the 1981 Bill of Rights Act (the closest thing NZ has to an entrenched Constitution) and the founding plank upon which the Treaty of Waitangi has meaning.

"It does not matter if you're pro or anti monarchy but if you take away the DUE AUTHORITY of law (which includes our flag) you then open the gates of hell, or to be precise the means in which John Key can legally sign the TPPA (Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement). Currently if the matter was taken to court it would undoubtedly end up at the Supreme Court." 

The post continues to explain how the attempt to change the New Zealand flag is actually a conspiracy by a number of politicians who want to change the way that judges are appointed, which can then lead to the removal of various political rights (they're especially keen on "freedom of speech"), ban "proper" religious teachings (they have a special interpretation of the bible which obviously doesn't involve organised religion, they're part of the conspiracy), rework the education system to make people more compliant and so forth.

Despite all this there does seem to be a kernel of truth in their writings about Nile. At least the facts seem accurate and in accord to other published information concerning the size of the company, its senior staff, its operations and so forth. More to the point the make it very clear on their website that they have *secret* information about Nile corporation which they will only divulge to "genuine freedom fighters".

"Due Authority" are located in a well-built, if small, former Baptist Church in one of the poorer areas of the city (Newtown), where they have a New Age store which sells various crystals, homeopathic cures ("just add water"), a resin statues of dragons and faeries. Beyond that there is the bookstore which has a range of books on numerology, the secrets of the (insert ancient or contemporary religious tradition), UFOs, and political texts on the Freemasons, the Illumaniti, the Rosicrucians, the international banking cartels, vaccinations, Chemtrails, HAARP, Deep State, and so forth. Then there's "the really serious stuff", as one helpful bookshop seller will explain, on New Zealand nationalism and anti-Roman Christianity and how NZ is actually the last remaining vestige of deceny in the world. 

If the PC Workers ask about Nile and the special secret information it will be explained that they don't give that information away to anyone. To test their sincerity they will be invited back to a "special meeting" in two days time and given several books to read on the special identity of New Zealand and of Nile Corporation. The books are overpriced and the shop only takes cash. If an attempt is made to pay be credit card the purchaser will be sold another book on how RFID chips in cards are a vector to them compulsory as implants in people. The books will take 12 strategic turns to read due the intricate complexity that is contained and a successful Formidable (15+) Investigate check is required to remember the finer details, which the PC Workers will be quizzed on at the meeting.

The books will contain information on how Nile is actually a company headed and financed by people of Anglo-Egyptian backgrounds, who have taken the various motifs and forms of ancient Egypt as part of their corporate identity. The former is well known, indeed obvious, but the latter checks out on with other sources. The books go into a great deal of research into the backgrounds of the financiers which indicates some fairly serious research on the part of the author, Zacharia Aleph. The books then go onto a fairly in-depth discussion about various aspects of Egyptian mythology, most of which again seems to be fairly accurate. 

What is more speculative however is that the people behind Nile corporation are actually a group of Ancient Egyptian pagans who are seeking to take over the world, and are using their book distribution network to funnel information and control, and that this has been ongoing since the end of the second world war (i.e., well before Nile was founded). Aleph shows, in notable detail, how various members of the families associated with Nile where involved in a number of well-known historical events ranging from the assasination of Kennedy, the Moon landings, the sacking of Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, Watergate, the rise of Gorbachev, the fall of communism, the introduction of a commercial Internet, 9/11, and so forth. The power of Nile is really quite surprising!

If the PC Workers finish the books an attend the meeting they will be introduced by various "Brothers" and "Sisters" and will be required to donn masks, to ensure anonymity. They will be introduced as "Brother" or "Sister" as desired will a new name, representing their "secret identity" as part of "Due Authority". They will be then quizzed on the the contents of the books that they passed. If they PC Workers pass the tests the author of the books, and head of Due Authority will explain how the financiers and senior management of Nile corporation are actually secretly shape-shifting Nile River crocodiles. Which eat people, obviously.

**BMX Kids (aka The Bandits)**

The BMX Kids are a group of several mostly male adolescents aged between 12 and 15 who scoot around the city on the own BMX bikes. When out-of-office (just before arriving at work, leaving work, lunch break) one or more PC Workers will notice these urchins in a local laneway and overhear (Sense (Hearing), TN 7) one exclaim excitedly, "There's Post-It (TM) note under the keyboard!". If a PC worker looks down the laneway they will notice a number of the youngsters "dumpster diving" among some discarded computer parts. A Knowledge (General) skill check (TN 9) or Craft (computing) (TN 9) will ascertain that the excitement is about discovering someone's password.

If approached the BMX Kids will be extremely wary and may even attempt to flee, however appropriate coaxing (Seduce skill, using bribery, TN 7) will encourage them to stay and talk. The three main bandits, High-Fly (famed for their big jumps), Emu (an Australian), and The Code (a bespectacled girl) will do most of the talking and despite being the seniors among the game (i.e., they're 14-15) they are just as prone to having loose lips when it comes to describing their criminal abilities. Specifically the BMX Kids will claim that there there isn't a computer or building that they can't get into, "for a price", The Code adds. If a price is requested, High-Fly will blurt out "Five hundred dollars!", causing Emu to grimace. Kindly PC Workers may offer them double that, just to ensure their loyalty.

The reality is that these are just kids; they do have some skills in the the areas that they think they are the city's best, but they are not professional criminals by any stretch of the imagination, although a particularly Machiavellian party will find a "patsy" use for them. Given their age they will have characteristics around 25%  lower than their adult levels (a more fine-grained description of section 1.4 Characteristics, in the core rulebook). They also have a full complement of background skills. The BMX Kids have typically swapped "Pilot" for "Bike" in their background skills, and have a bonus to Stealth (and other skills) on account of their relatively size. One interesting identifier for the group is that they talk in late 1970s slang and have preference for 1970s pop music, even including the Bay City Rollers for some incomprehensible reason.

*Slang*

The following are some example slang terms that the BMX Kids will use. A Knowledge (general) skill check at -2 is required to work out what the hell they are talking about, unless the character was in their teens or twenties in the 1970s.

"Do me a solid" i.e., "Can you do me a favour?"
"Boogie down!" i.e., "Let's party!"
'The Man', Everything from government, bosses, and parents.
'10-4', i.e., "Affirmative", from Citizen's Band slang
'Bear', i.e., "A police officer", from Citizen's Band slang
'Space cadet' i.e., "A person with an interest in science and not paying attention to other cool things".
'Skinny', i.e., "The whole and deep truth"

### 5.1.3 Nile, Ground Floor

Based on the foreshore of Wellington and having received city council approval to remove several old warehouses, the Pyramid of Nile is a massive ediface of glass and steel in the same propostions as the Great Pyramid of Giza, although at 1/10th of the size. It stands 23 metres per side and 14.6 metres tall, not including an extra 2 metres of radio attenae, with an incline of 51 degrees, with the sides of the square base at cardinal points. Whilst some architects have marvelled at the iconic building, town planners have argued that the Pyramid of Nile is an inefficient desing for a city such as Wellington where flat land is at a premium. More cynical economists have noted that perhaps the primary business of Nile is not book distribution, but real estate speculation.  

The pyramid has long range security cameras mounted on the angles, each of which have a range of 100m, and three at each entrance, two facing along the opposite base, and one facing ahead. At the second level there are, obviously, no entrance based security cameras, but there are cameras facing downwards along the pyramid angles to ensure that nobody is climbing up. There is no security cameras on the third level. Within the building there is a basic motion detector, alarm system, and short-range/wide angle camera is each major room and corridor.

The computer system consists of an overall network, plus VLANs with wired and wireless access for each department which requires network administrator access to enter from oustide. Use of VPNs from home to the office are common. The archives and data centre for the company is on the first floor and is known among the staff as "The Minotaur's Maze" on account of the confusing layout.

The ground floor consists of four entrances into the Pyramid of Nile, one general business and the occasional public (such as school trips), two entrances for truck bound deliveries (inwards and outwards), and one entrance for transport inbound and outbund shipping. At each entrance there is a a guard post and first aid centre, and nearby is the fire panel for the floor. The staff at the trucking and shipping entrances are notably more surly than those at the public entrance, and the public entrance also have two reception staff. The Security staff are not armed, but do have access to a police emergency button. Twice during the night time one security guards from each station will take a walk around the perimeter to ensure that everything is fine; it's a fair walk and will take the guards a good twenty minutes to complete the 1.6km trek. At all times at least one security guard has Survival skill representing their first and second aid training.

Nota bene: Set in New Zealand, where Commonwealth English predominates, the first level is typically referred to as the "ground floor", and the second level as the "first floor", and the third level as the "second floor". This may be different to what U.S. readers are more familiar with.

**G1 Business Entrance**

The business entrance to Nile Corporation is a large open area of marble and chrome, rather like business hotel lobby. A reception desk has two staff who check-in visitors and issue identity cards for staff and passes for visitors. These cards cover all the rooms for the ground level and first level, but not level two. In addition there are two well-dressed and friendly security staff during the daytime, replaced with more surly staff in the evening. Using "Generic Security Guard" and "Generic Receptionist" for statistics.

*G1, G2, G3 Generic Security Guard*

The generic security guard is big, burly, but also professional. Nile has been very careful to select security guards with the right disposition and experience and their selection of guards has been very successful. These security guards will do everything by the book and record that they did it by the book. Note that some security guards have one level less in Profession in favour of Survival, representing their first aid training.

*G2 Generic Reception Staff*

The reception staff are, as per the generic gender and age roles so common in a corporate environment, young and female. Again however, like the security staff, Nile takes pride in the quality and professionalism and these staff, and encourages them from this early start in their career to follow the company procedures.

Housed within the business entrance, but against the outside glass is a coffee shop, appropriately entitled "Hobgoblins", which apparently the leaseholders think is a selling point. It sells the usual fare that one would find in such places, but of the worst possible quality. The coffee is invariably burnt, the milk is probably past its use-by date, the cakes are dry (and yet so full of sugar you'll need to be scrapped off the ceiling). The cafe's hours are indiscernable as well, and appear to be random (for all purposes in a game session, they are - there's a 50% chance that they'll be open at some stage during 8am to 5pm).

The staff are three burly women with a colourful command of the English language. At any one time one of them will be outside having a cigarette. They do not take too kindly to any complaints about the quality of their coffee, tea, or food and woe to anyone who does so; one of the staff members keeps a good supply of "Micky Finns" in her purse and will slip it in a consumable if anyone has a problem, whilst feigning concern; it will be the equivalent of 6 therapeutic doses (c.f., Heroin, Opiates, Barbiturates, and other 'Downers' section 2.2, *Papers & Paychecks*).

One advantage of the location however is that some visitors from another related company (shipping, printing supplies, couriers, whatever) are also at the coffee shop when the PC Workers make their first visit. A standard Sense (Hearing) check (TN 7) will mean they will over-hear a conversation on how they dislike dealing with Nile, how they've been wronged, and how they would like to get back at them. This is an opportunity for PC Workers to find some outside allies who are prepared to do some damage to Nile, pro bono.

**G2 Incoming Land Deliveries ("The Orcs")**

With a far less salabrious entrance, a stream of trucks make their way here for incoming supplies. During the day there are at four storers and packers to move and stack boxes, and engage in stock control. In the evening there are two security guards, who spend most the night taking an occasional walk outside or not really viewing the security camera feed. Use the G1 Generic Security Guard statistics and the G2 Generic Storer and Packer stastics. There is also a forklift and several trolleys present.

There is about 30 day shift packers and 20 night shift packers on duty in the incoming land delivery, outgoing land delivery, and sea delivery offices, with one supervisor for each room and shift (use generic supervisor). The packers take great delight in shocking people with their colourful, coase, and sexual language and their propensity to have scantily-clad beauties on calendar displays (the few female members of staff have provided their own version of well-buffed firemen in similar poses). Many are experts at union regulations for occupational health and safety and can quote vebatim if the need arises.

Whilst they will bicker among themselves, constantly, they will also band together with alarming speed if there is any perceived threat to their workplace solidarity. By this they primarily mean not having to work too hard. The night-shift workers have become particularly expert at this, and have even mapped out where to avoid all the cameras within the floor, just in case someone needs a quick nap.

Almost needless to say the supervisors are not held in high-regard by the packers. If, by some miracle, the PC Workers manage to get the packers onside they can provide information of where to stand and walk pretty much throughout all of level one and not be seen by the security cameras, as well as the provision of protective clothing, overalls, and coaching in union regulations which can stop most questions from other staff on level one and two.

*Generic Storer and Packers*

Usually male (there is one female S&P staff member in incoming land deliveries), storers and packers tend to alternate between two professions, labourer and administrator, as their job involves moving goods, storing them, and keeping stock control. This is not great for their pay-rates or for that matter their need to be both strong and wise, but at least gives them the combined perks of both professions simultaneously.

**G3 Outgoing Land Deliveries**

In all ways identical to G2 Incomimg Land Deliveries, except the value-added products depart from this point. As per G2 there are four storers and packers during the day and two security guards during the night. Use the G1 Generic Security Guard statistics and the G2 Generic Storer and Packer stastics.

**G4 Incoming and Outgoing Sea Deliveries**

Again, similar to G2 and G3, except the storemen here handle both incoming and outgoing goods for sea delivery and movement to the nearby docks. Use the G1 Generic Security Guard statistics and the G2 Generic Storer and Packer stastics. These are of a larger but less frequent volume, and the presence of several forklifts and only a few trolleys is a result of the difference. One of these forklifts is a monster, as is the security camera. The forklift enjoys pranking the storers and packers by moving pallets when there is nobody about, and the camera enjoys being in on the joke as well. 

**G5 Janitors' Storeroom ("The Shunned Cavern")**

Located behind the Sea Deliveries and next the toilets is the ground floor Janitors' Storeroom. The two janitors are two brothers Yuri and Boris, are migrants from Kalingrad, Russia. Of similar height and build the main way to tell the two apart is that Yuri is the contemplative and morose one, whereas Boris is outgoing and belligerent. True to the stereotype of such individuals they are both massive, with thick accents, and thoroughly unpleasant to almost everyone. Plus, they love to drink although they are wise enough to know that drinking at work is prohibited - so they disguise the smell of drinking alcohol with vast quantities of cleaning alcohol. In addition to several bottles of vodka carefully hidden in their storeroom Yuri and Boris also have a vast array of cleaning products, of which several when mixed together could possibly contravene the Geneva Convention on Chemical Weapons.

This said, both Yuri and Boris are loyal to those whom they've developed a grudging respect for, which includes the Nile corporation. Getting them onside would be beneficial, as they are prepared to carry out small additional tasks for appropriate gifts. Their cleaning shift starts in the early hours of the morning and finished just before lunchtime, starting from the ground floor and working their way up. Note that Yuri and Boris do have passes that work for the top level of the Nile pyramid, however they are carefull encoded to work between 10.30am and 11.30am only. The janitors also have the additional role of being morning shift building wardens which means that they can operate the fire panels, and clear the floors for real or imagined fires. If they latter in in place, staff will return after thirty minutes.

**G6 Production and Distribution Room ("Kobolds")**

This large 'n' shaped room is staffed almost entirely by young men and women aged from 16 to 19, with the exception of a small number of older supervisors who are in their early 20s. The workers here are responsible entirely for the printing and the physical movement of various goods within the Nile offices and the transfer of books, periodicals etc, to outbound sources.

The place is one of extraordinary chaos and seems to operate more due to luck than effective organisation. Overall there are about thirty staff who scoot about here who apparently are too busy to stop and talk to anybody even, and especially, their supervisors. If one is cornered and asked a question, they'll find an escape route and then flee ("Hang-on, I’ll just need to check..." - and then never come back).

Some bright spark thought it was a good idea to give all these workers a special Nile uniform, loosely based on the uniform of the Egyptian police. As a result is is quite easy to confuse who is who on the floor, and activity which the staff take some delight in. "Oh no, I'm John, not Joe.  Joe was just down here, hang on, I'll go and check.."

Another aspect among these teenaged pranksters is that the almost every object in the building seems to be trapped in some way. Computer and power cables serve as highly effective trip-wires, pot plants seem to be positioned on desks designed to cause cascading collapses of files, and even desks are positioned in such a position that people will clip their upper thigh (or worse) as they go past. Printer's ink is an especially delightful staining material. Polished floors are *so* slippery. Curiously, the staff never seem to get caught by these traps.

There has been a succession of supervisors in this office, mostly business graduates straight up of university. After all, how difficult could it be to manage a bunch of high-school drop-outs, right? Two have returned to university for a second degree in adolscent psychology, one has decided to move to Masterton and become a shepherd, and another, tragically, had a nervous breakdown and has had be institutionalised.

Tucker's Kobolds actually feel bad about the last one. They're pranksters, and their pranks are meet to frustrate rather than cause harm. Yes, "Tucker's Kobolds" is what they call themselves, and they're led a seemingly non-descript individual named Tucker. Every Saturday night ringleaders meet at his house, and over movies and popcorn they work out what dastardly tricks they'll play the following week. 

For all their mischief, they are actually fairly productive, and for this reason the chaos of the Production and Distribution has not been subject to senior management intervention. If one could manage to befriend Tucker or his ringleaders - and they do operate on a dictum of "don't trust anyone who isn't our age" - they would find a very useful ally as they are in charge of all the internal mail.

**G7 Secretarial Pool ("The Goblins", "The Ogre")**

Located behind the business reception and with access to the main lifts and the production and distribution room, this "U" shaped office serves as a complement to "The Kobolds" in terms of business logic and a counter-point to "The Orcs" in terms of characters and disposition. The twenty staff here are the backbone administrators of the company, mainly female, constantly in motion, and managing to look extremely busy and overworked.

This things are not quite untrue, in reality, they are very good at deflecting work, especially among each other. Indeed, it is not uncommon for a particular task to circulate around the office ("Jenny, could you do this for me? I'm so busy at the moment") until it comes back to the person who was originally supposed to do it. In addition to deflecting work, the secretarial pool is very impressive at their knowledge of office gossip and office politics. They know exactly who is doing what with whom, and how often, and even any level of involvement with the group will quickly become an induction into this dirty laundry, which could certainly be useful to the purposes of the PC Workers. Note however, like most gossip it has a tenuous relationship with the truth at best.

The head of the team is an extremely competent administrator, Bree Yark, who is not above engaging in this rumour mill herself. Whenever an administrator is stuck with a particularly complex problem and their immediate colleagues cannot help (such as contradictory procedures), a cry will come up from the floor where he name is simply exclaimed in full: "Bree Yark!" Contrary to popular belief this does not sound anything like "Hey Rube" and Bree herself instituted the practise. It has become code for "We surrender!". This will happen several times a day.

In a private office beyond the secetarial poll (G7a) is Al Bear who is one of the few male members of this highly-gendered pool and unsurprisingly is the floor manager, although he is also technically in charge of the other staff on this level as well. Al is a big guy, of Maori background, with bushy beard, red-checked flanellette shirt, and spray-on jeans. He is also as camp as a row of tents. He and Bree get along very well, sharing all sorts of comical stories of internal office shenanigans and affairs; especially affairs. Al Bear's nickname is "The Ogre" on account of his great size. After all, calling him something like "Owl Bear" would be ridiculous. Who would stick an owl's head on a bear? 

Bree and Ogre are in deep cohoots with each other, with Bree typically finding ways to prevent access to Ogre ("he's a very busy man"). Further, they have accumulated a great deal of serious dirt on all their fellow employees, and despite Bree's feigned behaviour, they actually have a good idea of what is true and alse rumours. Note that Bree does not have special social skills in hiding her deceptions, so a capable PC Worker will be able to differentiate between true and false gossip coming from her.

This can be both a disaster or a benefit for the PC Workers. By accumulating the collective research skills of her staff, Bree Yark can create quite a dossier on the PC Workers. However, both Bree and Al are also prone to expensive tastes, and, with some consideration, get the PCs out of a difficult situation with an appropriate "gift".

## 5.2 Scenario: Palaces of the Electrum Princess

### 5.2.1 Introduction 

"Years ago the valley was green, and animals ran free through golden fields of grain", or so the story goes.

The princess Venice Novateló ruled over these peaceful campsites and the people were secure and happy. They were happy campers. She wasn't a real princess, but that didn't matter because this is a postmodern story.

Then one day a real-estate developer driving a red Maserati appeared in the driveway of the princess' little bed and breakfast and almost overnight the campsites fell into development.

They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot. Now there's only pink hotels, serviced by big yellow taxis. Plenty of rumors remain, and what legends there are tell of a fabulous dreamcatcher is somewhere within the Palaces of the Electrum Princess.

**Plot Introduction**

In the Palace of the Electrum Princess, the PC workers are induced to a high-stakes game of real-estate subterfuge. Starting in any of the hotels according to the Boss's choosing, the PC workers have just completed yet another mind-numbing corporate training session on team-building and are having a couple of post-work drinks before the long-weekend, when they are approached by an older woman who is well-dressed in a style of clothes that belongs in the late 1960s, but obviously distressed. Asking for the PCs leave to sit, she tells a sorrowful tale, introducting herself as Ms. Venice Novateló.

"You must excuse me for prying, but I have done some research on you. You're all very capable people and probably the best we could find for the task at hand. 'We', you ask? Yes, there is a number of us. We used to be the owners of the land here, where we had our commune. We had nature, birds and wild animals, a little stream, and grew mung-beans and sprouts. Unfortunately we have lost that ownership. You see, rather than having the ownership registered through a land title, we used a series of steps so it was ultimately owned by possession of a paper title, registered through Los Republicos dos los Bananes. I know what you're thinking. We wanted to minimise our involvement with our government and the republic had a revolutionary people's government. It seemed like a good idea at the time."

"Anyway, one day Mr X turned up, and decided this was a fine place for his new property development. He apparently had made some inquiries beforehand, and seemed to know exactly what he needed to do. He wooed my daughter, Venice, with stories of wealth and high-society easy-living, and she stole the paper deed. Well, technically it wasn't stolen, because she was a member of the executive council at the time. You see we have an annual election for the execuite committee of the commune and ... I'm sorry I'm sure you don't need to know these details."

"The practical upshot is that she gave Mr X the title, and now we're forbidden to even be here (she says, sotto vocce). Venice won't talk to me or any of her old friends and she seems to have taken up an entirely new llfe with Mr. X. She used to be such a lovely little girl. The stories she would tell each morning from her dream-catcher, which she named "Mr. Dreamy". You wouldn't believe her wonderful imagination... Oh, I'm sorry, I'm going off-track. Business is at hand. We believe that you are of negotiable virtue, so I have brought with me (she pushes over tassel-bag), ten thousand dollars in cash, and another forty thousand when you complete task. We need you to get that paper title back to us."

"Time is of the urgency. We have discovered that Mr. X and Venice have one-way tickets to Los Republicos dos los Bananes for Monday night. Sadly, the Republic is now ruled by Generallismo X EDIT and the friends that we have there are in prison or in hiding. Please, find that deed - and save my daughter."

An easy Sense (Visual) check at this point will indicate that two hotel security guards are having a conversation and are pointing in the direction of the PC workers. If alerted, Ms. Novateló will exclaim, "I have to go, please, save my daughter! Save her!" - and with that she departs quickly, leaving behind the money and with one of the security guards following closely. If the Sense check is failed, or if the PC workers don't alert Ms. Novateló, then one security guard will roughly escort her off the premises. In either case one security guard will question the PCs about their relationship with Ms. Novateló and what she wanted from them. Any plausible excuse will do as he is not paid for investigation.

**Boss's Introduction**

Most of what Ms. Novateló says is true, but she is woefully uniformed of some of the finer details and, in a way, she is partially to be blame. Venice Novateló was raised in splenid isolation from the rest of society, and was "educated" under the principles of Dr. Benjamin Spock EDIT with the principle that parents should give their children whatever they asked for. As a result, she become a completely spoiled and utterly irresponsible brat. This wasn't so bad in an environment where the greatest damage she could do was take more than her fair-share of goat milk, but when the rapacious Mr.X arrived on the scene circumstances changed dramatically. Mr.X offered her money, new clothes, stardom, and most importantly, hard drugs. All she had to do was hand over a silly piece of paper and not have anything to do with her hippie family ever again, and to that end she readily consented.

These days Venice spends her life in the most superficial and sensual activities. Her day will consist of getting out of a bed in one of the hotels quite late and with some strange but athletic partner from the night before who's name she has already forgotten, going to the beauty salon to get her hair and nails done, and then going out drinking champagne and snorting cocaine at the various clubs at the hotels, which are visited by young dispossessed nobility from Europe, up-and-coming movie stars, young pop stars, predatory aging rock stars etc. There is often a small gaggle of reporters following her around and she is very skilled in manipulating them through scandulous titallation - a review of glossy magazines will show various images where she appears to have a little bit of white powder on her upper lip, or there is just a hint of a nipple showing on a night-club floor due to a minor 'wardrobe failure'. Essentially, she is famous for being famous and is making no worthwhile contribution to existence. 

For their own part, Mr. X, came on to the scene with the single and express desire to make as much money as they possibly could and sought the symbols that they thought represented that wealth and success; a fast car, a slick suit, a big house etc. Mr. X., had previously been a relatively small player in the real-estate world, and whilst they were making a good middle-class income, they weren't heading towards the big time that they desperately desired. One night, hearing the story from a fried hippy of the commune with a paper deed, he saw what was his big break in life (apart from being born in a first-world country as middle-class white male) and, following a modicum of research, took the opportunity to get his hands on the title.

Unfortunately, Mr. X's desires to be rich and comfortable did not accord his business acumen. Whilst turning the former lands of the hippy commune into a hotel complex, he simulatenously managed cut corners everywhere and over-invest in the complex at the same time. Whilst plenty of cash flows through his hands, it is flowing out faster than it comes in, and the reality is that Mr. X., is effectively bankrupt. Mr X., also manages Venice's financial affairs, and whilst her lifestyle choices are expensive to say the least, he manages to make a good amount of underground income on the side by selling adult-entertainment videos of her favourite nocturnal habits via Interenet streaming cameras in her bedroom; Venice is, of course, utterly unaware of this. The reality however is that such adult entertainment can only generate a good income for so long, and Venice is reaching the point of no longer paying her way, so to speak. Whilst not brilliant, Mr. X. is not completely stupid. He's done the sums and realised that the writing is on the wall. He's bought two one-way tickets to take himself and Venice to a new life in Los Republicos dos Los Bananes where he hopes to start a new life in the cocaine import-export business. At the very least, Venice will be good for quality tetsing.

The official object of the PC worker's objective, the paper title deed, is kept in Mr X's office in a safe, with the two passports, tw0 one-way tickets to Republica dos Los Bananes via a small charter jet, a $100,000 cash, and an equivalent sum of cocaine. A secondary object is Venice's dream-catcher, Mr. Dreamy. When Mr X., offered Venice more drugs than he thought she could consume, and told her that she had to break off contact with her family, he symbolically broke the dream-catcher into four parts in front of her, and threw them away. But objects such as these have a habit of convincing people to rescue the components from the trash and they are now scattered in different parts of the four hotels. If the PC workers find the four parts, and repair the dream-catcher it will revive a spirit within it. If Venice is confronted with the dream-catcher the spirit will "attack" her, reminding her of the good times of her past life and when she was a better person.

### 5.2.2 Palace Ritz

Derived from the Ritz in Paris this three storey building is in the style of the classical architecture from the reign of Louis XIV and from looks quite beautiful on an initial glance. There is a total of 60 rooms on the second and third floors, whereas the ground floor has a restaurant, swimming pool and gymnasium, a comfortable lobby with adjacent bar, plus the the hotel's laundry and administration. There are two cleaning and laundry staff for the hotel, two people who work in administration, three kitchen and waiting staff, two personal trainers in the gymnasium, two people for security and grounds, and a gardener. The administration, laundry, and garden contain nothing of interest for this adventure, although they would have expected levels of security and potential rewards for petty thieves. The rooms are of a modest size, but include all the expected facilities (toilet, shower, TV, Wifi etc). 

Notably, everything about this hotel is fake, a complete facade one may suggest. Superficialy the furnishings appear to be in the style of the Louis XIV period; there are commodes, Mazarin desks, canapés, tables à gibier etc adorning every room. However, a discerning eye will quickly determine these are far from authentic. Where there should be marble, or wood, or really anything of value, there is chipboard and plastic laminate. Where there should be gilding there is yellow paint. Instead of oil paintings there are cheaply framed posters, albeit of the appropriate style. Instead of goose feather and down duvet and pillow filling, there is polyester. There are plastic flowers in the plastic vases. The quill sets on the desks of each room are plastic. In fact, even the walls of the building are made from plastic. At least it is all easy to clean, although if there is ever a fire the place will go up in a toxic fireball.

The restaurant is named "A demain" ("Until Tomorrow") although several of the current and mostly former staff have suggested that this is a mispelling of the phonetically equivalent "A deux mains" ("Using both hands"), referring to the maître d'hôtel's amorous predicilitions. The maître d' himself, Ali Monpourchien (which could be the phonetic "Aliment pour chien", i.e., dog food), is unsurprisingly not actually French or even remotely French, but a rather clever Egyptian who cannot believe his luck in finding a job where he can both pretend to French and can pretend to cook at the same time. In a more unfortunate act of self-delusion he also promotes the myth that the he is the world's greatest lover. Any female character who is even slightly attractive (CHA 12+) will inevitably receive a special visit from the chef, who will expound at length his skill at cooking with none-too-subtle sexual metaphors that invariably conclude with an offer to visit his room to help him make his especially thick and creamy Vichysoise.

The swimming pool and gymnaiusm is staffed by a French couple, XXX and XXX EDIT, who look like that they belong from a 1980s home-fitness TV show with their thin bodies, colourful leotards, legwarmers, big hair, and perfect smiles. On the various big-screen TVs throughout there fitness centres there is an endless repeat of stretching exercises with early 80s synthpop. The couple keep a busy schedule for interested guests of personal training, yoga classes, and even jazz ballet. Enrolling in any of these gruelling courses, which torture mind, body, and soul, which require visiting their office which is adorned in various fitness posters of the period, including their personal addition, a signed print of Oliver Newton-John's "Physical". Above this print attached to the wall is a quarter of the Venice's dreamcatcher. If asked they will say that they found it by the swimming pool just as they started working here. They're not particularly attached to it, but if will say they just thought they should keep it (this is the spirit of the dreamcatcher trying to prevent itself from being discarded). Any character who has this part of their dreamcatcher in their possession will dream of running and swimming outdoors, and will gain +1 to skill checks involving such activities.

### 5.2.3 Palace Cliveden

Derived from the Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, this hotel is designed in the style of an Italianate mansion and with a significant estate of very green grass which includes a sizable hedge maze, an English landscaped garden, complete with lake and ducks, and a 9-hole golf course. There is a total of 47 rooms and 15 suites, with ground floor wings which include a restaurant on one wing and a truly vast lounge and bar on the other, with the hotel administratrion and smaller lobby located at the central ground floor. 

As with the Palace Ritz, a pretense is made towards authenticity. It is true, for example, that the lounge has Chesterfield lounges and club chairs; anyone sitting on them will soon discover the sticky joy of the vinyl upholstery. The prints of famous hunting paintings are beautifully framed with baroque-styled gold plastic. Many will note that various whiskeys, crockery, foodstuffs etc are "By appointment" complete with crest, and whilst one may immediately think that these refer to products that hold a Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom), they are actually novelty crests referring to the Imperial and Royal Warrant of Appointment of the (former) Austro-Hungarian Empire. There are several animal trophies mounted in the bar and a close inspection will reveal them to be fakes etc.

The staff are a collection of the most unusual parodies of British culture, all in one place. The maître d'hôtel, Peter File, is always deadly serious with a stiff upper lip regardless of how ridiculous the situation he often finds himself in, which is common enough. Peter is well assisted by the far-too jovial accounts and bookings officer (and aspiring author) of ambiguous gender, Paige Turner who will also double as waiting staff on Friday and Saturday nights. The chef, Nick Oleslaw, is a strong believer in the artistic merit of British cuisine, and very much English cuisine in particular (recipes from Wales, Scotland, and Ireland are as close as he will get to "foreign"). "The English have only three vegetables and two of them are cabbage" is the notorious quote by Walter Page and Nick puts in practise with cabbage boiled in milk with suet and offal, cabbage with tripe, cabbage with mushy peas and kidneys etc. Expect to find haggis, jellied eels, stargazy pie, fried chocolate bars etc on the menu. Anyone who is unfamiliar with such far will have to make a test against the STR or suffer a -1 per 2 points of failure for all actions for a day, until the problem is passed (so to speak).

Another colourful character at the Cliveden is the slightly scruffy Major Grimes, a permanent resident. The Major is a former former naval officer who, in his late thirties, was an intelligence office on an outfitted fishing trawler that had been converted to a spy ship in the Falklands War. Unfortunately his hearing was damaged during that period due to close encounters with enemy shells, and now he is well and truly retired and effectively living in the bar, where he endlessly drones on about the quality of the scotch and the hush-hush missions that he had to engage in. Phlegmatic to the point of impossible, Major Gimes simply unfazeable regardless of what's going on around him. Which is just as well, as Major Grimes has a cache of unlicensed high-powered firearms stashed in his room. 

Another pair of likely characters are two young groundskeepers, Jack and William Smith, brothers from the North West region. Incorrigible pranksters they have developed increasingly elaborate plans to get a rise out of Major Grimes. This time they think they will actually achieve it on Guy Fawkes Night, which should coincide with the visit of the PC Workers. Responsible for maintenance of the golf course grounds, there will be of course an almighty bonfire on the night. The two brothers will get a golf-cart of fireworks and take them to the green of the 9th hole where they will blast a few shots in the general direction of the Major's room, whilst simultaneously playing Himno Nacional Argentino, the Argentine National Anthem. The combination of events will cause the Major to finally flip and start shooting at what he thinks is a Argentinian hit-squad finally catching up to him for his wartime deeds. For what it is worth, Jack and William also recovered a quarter of the Venice's dreamcatcher, and have mounted it on the 9th hole flagpole. Any character who has this part of their dreamcatcher in their possession will dream of gardens and nature, and will gain +1 to checks against stress or social attacks, as well as +1 for activities requiring fine manual dexterity.

### 5.2.4 Palace Raffles

Derived from the Raffles in Singapore, this hotel has 52 suites on the upper two levels, a small restaurant on each floor, and a shopping centre on the ground floor. The Palace Raffles shopping centre is closest to the main highway connecting the hotel complex to the outside world and as a result has quite a range of non-hotel visitors. The shopping centre has styled itself in the produce and presentation of a south-east Asian market, with the delicious smell of the durian fruit permeating throughout, along with shouts from traders in the hybrid Malay-Hokkein-English language, known as 'Singlish'. The hotel itself is built in a grand colonial Victorian style, with large verandahs circumnavigating the entire building and plenty of tropical trees, vines etc. The ground floor also houses the entrance and administration rooms. An amusing addition to the Palace Raffles is a pair of long tailed Monkey (Macaca fascicularis) imported from the Sacred Monkey Forest in Ubud, Bali. These charming critters will happily take gifts of fruit of various types and also have a penchant for borrowing expensive electronic equipment and glasses. They especially like the facial expressions that humans make when such items are smashed to smithereens.

The several warang-style restaurants in the shopping centre have challened the racist ethnic segregation policy of the Raffles-Jackson plan for Singapore, by mixing Malay, Indian, European, and Chinese cuisines, often all in the same dish, as long as it comes with a hefty supply of fish paste and firey-hot chillies. After all, clearly what was missing from the English porridge was a bit of fish paste, ginger, and curry sauce. Most of the restaurants will serve a meal with palm brandy that's sufficiently potent to be used as an alternative fuel source for their tuk-tuks, and an Indonesian "wine" that is part wine mixed with caramel and ginsing. This concoction is amazingly cheap but requires a two STR checks after consuming per bottle, with a -1 to all skill checks for every point failed due to its amazing capacity to produce inebriation and then shockingly bad hangovers. The recovery is 1 point per hour for inebriation and 1 point per two hours for the hangover. It's *that* bad.

In addition to the restaurants and grocers there are no less than four clothings stores which have a collective quarter of a store dedicated to menswear and no women's clothes that feature pockets. There's two shoe stores, although it is clear that the Imelda Marcos Memorial Temple is certainly winning the contest against the more sports-shoe orientated Wheels of Anuar Manan. Certainly some of the lace-up high-heeled boots would satisfy the former First Lady's reference to "martial law with a smile" (or at the very least a grimace). There are at least three beauty salons for hair, nails, and other critically important service industries, including one (Princess Changping) which has absolutely astronomical prices but actually offers a private service to match. It is here that there is a very high chance that Venice and her entourage can be found. In addition there is a pharmacy (another popular place for Venice to send one of her underlings), a small hardware-cum-cobbler-cum-keycutter, and a newsagent. Every single one of these stores (even the newsagent) engage in the ancient art of haggling. Expressions of violence accusations over price are, of course, simply a cultural misundertanding.

And what would such a shopping centre be without the darling urchins who add a lot of local colour? The scallywags have an astoundingly good variety of techniques to remove a visitor of their possessions including a convincing begging routine of an incurable twisted and broken ankle (+6 Acting skill total), which is actually double-jointed, whilst a pair of colleagues collects what is carried in purses, backpacks, and backpockets (+5 Sleight skill total). As is often the case this gang is controlled by an older businessman who runs a higher-class restaurant, and karaoake bar, one Hung Long, whose has an appropriately reputation (often in *Papers & Paychecks* you may have noticed that NPCs do match their name because the universe is an aesthetic place). The winner of karaoke night (as voted by the patrons) gets to choose and item of their selection from a pile of accumulated goods which were not valuable enough to make to the black market. Among the imitation designer watches and the like is garish mixed-media painting which includes another quarter part of the fabled dreamcatcher. Possession of this portion of the dreamcatcher will generate vivid dreams of international cuisine, generating a +1 bonus to cooking and a +2 STR bonus of protection of any sort of poisoning.

### 5.2.5 Palace Beverly Hills 

Derived from the Beverly Hills Hotel, of Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California, this hotel has 75 suites, and 8 bungalows. It is the pride and joy of the establishment and as a result charges commensurate prices. With a style that is not-quite art deco with various pastel pink and light greens throughout the the entire complex (looking rather like the after-effects of too much pink spumante mixed with a spinach and riccotta pie), and not-quite functionalist 1960s functionalism, and not-quite Disneyland, the Palace Beverly Hills somehow succeeds in generating a nauseating combination of the worst all three. Nevertheless, there is an impressive entrance with a extensive lobby and semi-covered dining area which backs onto a wading pools whose water curiously matches the colour-scheme of the building. Matching the style the furnishings throughout the hotel are the finest cane and ratten, especially the roofs of the bungalows which can generate an authentic feeling of being in a Pacific Island storm if the weather assists.

Palace Beverly Hills is three stories high, with thirty room on on the second and third floors and fifteen on the ground floor which also hosts the lobby, bar, and restaurant. Beyond the dining area, swimming pools, and bungalows is a sprawling golf course with so many electric carts scooting about that one would be forgiven the prime purpose of golf is to hit a ball and go for a walk. This said, many of the people at Palace Beverly Hills require such vehicles. Whether it is simply a matter of genetics, bad diet, or lack of exercise, the proportion of people who fall into the obese scale of the BMI is close to one hundred percent. Actually anyone staying here will soon find out that the local restaurant, "Lard Have Mercy", is a contributing factor. Here the historical food pyramid is inverted, so refined sugars, corn syrup, trans-unsaturated fats, etc provide a foundation which works its way up to minimal provision of vegetables, salads, and fruit. For Sundays its also becomes an church where one can possibly receive the most nutritious meal of the week - loaves and fishes. A hefty donation is requisite, as Rev. Telly Vangelist needs a new private jet. After all, how is he going to travel to those poor people in foreign countries and spread the good word? The Reverend Telly of course has their own secret and is always on the lookout for handsome young men to join him on these journeys where he can fulfil his sense of charity - "it is better to give than to receive". Training for such exotic journeys are often carried out in the Telly's bunga-bungalow. 

The only people found at the Palace Beverly Hills who don't fall into the WASP stereotype are the workers. The olive-skinned chef, Jim Balaya, is of Creole Louisiana background, and speaks English, French, and Spanish fluently. He is also surprisingly thin, given the food that he cooks and the reason for this is quite simple - he never eats a meal. Certainly he snacks all day on whatever is being prepared, but no-one has ever seen him sit down and eat a meal. Whilst one may assume that his grazing activities are sufficient what is unknown to almost all is that Jim keeps a secret stash of fresh fruit and vegetables in the restaurant's walk-in fridge, which he snacks on when nobody is looking. As much as he loves providing mountains of foie gras, the fluffiest white bread, dishes constructed out of chicken and pork fat, impossibly sweet pastries, and so forth, he is less of a fool that his customers. In fact, he is deliberately trying to kill them; so far four people at the hotel have suffered fatal heart attacks. One day a psychologist will discover that Jim's impoverished (and often hungry) childhood has led him to a position where he derives pleasure from watching the people that he despises most die from the culinary pleasure that he can provide them. This is in part inspired by the whisperings of "Cheesecake", the feminine fridge with a Fieldmarshall personality, who shares this extreme disdain for the well-to-do. Why 'Cheesecake'? Because everyone knows that revenge is a sweet dish best served cold.


## 5.3 Camp 22

Synopsis: A mash-up between the novel 'Catch 22' and Hoeryong concentration camp in North Kora (known as Camp 22), which makes use of the setting "So You Want It Darker?", from a perspective of spurious logic.

# Crime and Punishment

"Please, Your Honor," whined Pauper William Nodes, 27, in a London court last week, "don't part me and the rat." The judge looked appraisingly at Nodes' pet rat in a cage on the barristers' table, frowned severely at Nodes. Clearing his throat he then did British Justice: "I sentence you, William Nodes, to six months in prison as an incorrigible rogue. The rat will be sent to a good home."

Three decades ago Will McLean brought us many laughs with the "Papers & Paychecks" illustration in the Dungeon Masters Guide for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. A cursory search will reveal that on more than one occasion the thought has entered the heads of others that "Papers and Paychecks" would make a great roleplaying game.

In 2017 this game became a reality, a 128 page book with artwork from Dan 'Smif' Smith, famous for his illustrations from the GURPS line of books, Randall Munroe's famous XKCD comics, and with a foreword by the first employee of TSR, Tim Kask. In "Papers & Paychecks" the world itself is downright hostile towards the PCs on a metaphysical level, although usually in a manner that is hilarious. 

*Cow-Orkers in the Scary Devil Monastry* is the first supplement for *Papers & Paychecks*, there are new character classes, new equipment, new NPCs, new settings (fantasy, noir), and new scenarios, including "Keep Our Borderlands", "The Palace of the Electrum Princess", and "Camp 22".
