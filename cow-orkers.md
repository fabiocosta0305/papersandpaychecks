# 1.0 Additional Character Classes

*Papers & Paycheck* can be a very adaptable game system. Whilst the character professions in the core rulebook as designed to be a broad representation of the various jobs found in a workplace, it has been pointed out that there were other professions that don't quite fit. Thus, more niche professions are offered here for such games.

## 1.1 Sporting Professions

### 1.1.1 The Athlete

Prime Requisite: Strength
Starting Age: 15+1d4
Profession Skills: Athletics (Strength), Athletics (Stamina), Intimidate, Jump, Melee, Swim, Knowledge (General), Profession, Carousing, Sense (various) 

Description: An professional athlete engages in competitive sports which involve strength, endurance, or speed for their livelihood. Like the labourer they are not always known for their intellect, but their physical prowess is unsurpassed, which can make them very popular in some social situations such as the participation in "paired athletics". An athlete is, of course, vary rare in the usual settings of *Papers & Paychecks* but they are not unknown in some contexts or as a past profession. Like labourers, athletes gains points in physical characteristics as their level improves. Athletes have an extremely low base wage, but this is off-set by receiving double their attribute bonus (or penalty is a weedy person decides to be come an athelete) to this wage. The starting age of a athlete with no prior profession is often quite young.

| Level | Wage     | Perks			|
|-------|----------|----------------------------|
| 1	| $700     | +1 Run or +0.25 Swim Move  |
| 2	| $800     | +1 to STR or PER	        |
| 3	| $900     | +2 Physical Hit Points     |
| 4	| $1000    | +1 to STR or DEX           |
| 5	| $1100    | +1 Run or +0.25 Swim Move  |
| 6	| $1150    | +1 to STR or PER           |
| 7	| $1200    | Adoring Fans		|
| 8	| $1250    | +1 to STR or PER           |

### 1.1.2 Agent

Prime Requisite: Intelligence
Starting Age: 15+3d4
Profession Skills: Act, Administration, Craft (Computing), Craft (writing), Gamble, Insight, Knowledge (Laws), Knowledge (General), Language (various)

Description: A sports agent acts as the legal representative of other sporting professions, making recommendations and negotiating for pay and benefits. As can be expected the often work for a commission of the sporting professionals salary (around 5-10% is typical) and will often have some legal background. The sporting agent is often depicted as being sly although empirical studies backing this conventional wisdom are lacking. This may be because the agent is typically older than the sportsperson, understands the law better, and is more intelligent - all of which results in much better pay that those they represent. In conventional *Papers & Paychecks* games the Agent is probably more commonly encountered than other sporting professionals due to their interactions with the corporate world.

# 2.0 Additional Actions and the Environment

## 2.1 More Action Rules

Yesterday,   
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.   
Now my database has gone away.   
Oh I believe in yesterday.   

Suddenly,   
There's not half the files there used to be,   
And there's a milestone   
hanging over me   
The system crashed so suddenly.   

I pushed something wrong   
What it was I could not say.  
Now all my data's gone away  
and I long for yesterday

Yesterday
The need for back-ups seemd so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday

## 2.2 More Equipment

*Potion of Animal Control*: A curious alcoholic beverage, usually of a mid-strength cheap beer or white wine, requires by to be drunk by the "animal". An "animal" in this case being a particularly festive college-aged indvidual. Once consumed the "animal" will effectively have no resistance to the provider of the beverage for 32 rounds for animals of 01-05 CON, half that time for 06-15 CON, and a quarter of that time for CON 16-25, etc. ENC 1, cost $5 (for the drink) + $995 if the the control properties are known.

*Potion of Dragon Control*: Another curious alcoholic beverage, usually a cheap sweet sherry or rot-gut whiskey, requires to be drunk by the "dragon". A "dragon" in this case being a particularly odious mother- or father-in-law. Once consumed the "dragon" will effectively have no resistance to the provider of the beverage for 32 rounds for animals of 01-05 CON, half that time for 06-15 CON, and a quarter of that time for CON 16-25, etc. ENC 1, cost $5 (for the drink) + $995 if the the control properties are known.

*Potion of Fire Breath*: A rarefied commercial chilli sauce with a Scoville rating of some 3 million units, the consumption of even a drop of potion of fire breath will cause a wound per drop consumed and will cause a bruise to anyone the character breathes upon for the next 10 rounds. They will, however, require to make a successful CON roll with a target number of 11 to act each of these round due the excruciating pain that they will be experiencing. ENC 0, cost $20

*Potion of Flying*: From a near-random sample of out-of-date medications a potion of flying is created, or at the very least, the consumer thinks so. A sensible person may think this is dangerous and there is a degree of truth to it. The consumer will have a great sense of euphoria for a strategic turn for characters of CON 06-15, twice that time for characters with CON 01-05, and half that time for characters of CON 16-25, etc. In addition to the euphoria the consumer will experience a high sense of lucidity, which will provide a bonus of +5 to any task that requires intellectual creativity. After the potion of flying wears off however, the character will feel depressed and will have a -5 penalty to such tasks, for twice as long as the original effect of the potion. What goes up, must come down. ENC 0, cost $100

`https://xkcd.com/353/`

*Rod of Dowsing*: An otherwise L-shaped or Y-shaped stick can be used in to locate ground water, oil, precious metals or gems, and even old gravesites. When used by a person who believes in the superstition, they gain a +5 bonus in discovering what they are searching for. When it is subject to scientific observation, it will fail to operate. ENC 1, cost $5000.

*Staff of Striking*: A staff of striking is specialist targetting weapon that especially affects any characters with levels in Labourer or Tradesperson. The bearer of the staff, upon striking the ground, an attracting the attention of members of said classes within hearing range, will provide a bonus of +5 to attempts to influence said characters but only for the purpose of encouraging them to withdrew their labour from their employer. The range, of course, is quite effective in a room with wooden floorboards and a high roof, and is less effective outside on a windy day. Artificial enhancement of the sound and speech is still effective. ENC 2, cost $5000. 

*Vicarious and Vacuous Grimoire*: "Like sands through the hourglass...." This tome provides drama utterly inane and ficticious characters, their relationships, challenges (especially romantic), and intrigues. Whilst utterly bereft of useful information it is also extraordinarily compelling, and any character who so much as reads the first page will have to make a WIS check with a difficulty of 11. If they fail they will spend the next 15 strategic turns doing nothing but reading the story of the Cordroy and Chime families. During this time their INT is reduced by 5, and their CHA by 5 as they insist on trying to tell all and sundry of the tale. Worse still, when completing the book they find there is another volume, which also requires a WIS check to resist purchasing and reading; "It Never Ends". ENC 1, cost $100

*Wand of Lightening*: Through the very strange machinations of the universe, when a wand a lightening is directed at a physical object the weight of that object will reduce by 10% as long as the wand is remains directed and the object is not actually weighed. The wonders of paranormal science! ENC 1, cost $2000.

*Wand of Magic Missiles*: This short black wand has white tips, rather like a classic stage magician's item. When engaging in a social attack, the social barbs used by the attacker have the curious effect of causing double damage, i.e., with a successful attack the social bruises, or even wounds, are doubled. The attacker will look quite foolish of course, pointing a stick at a person in an argument, but they are surprisingly convincing. ENC 1, cost $2000.

*Wand of Curling*: With multiple sticks, the electrical or battery-powered Wand of Curling will provide a bonus to an Acting skill via disguise. ENC of 1, cost of $100.

**Snail mail magic communications** 

by Fred

This magical device can be constructed out of many different types of boxes that vary in size or shape with the single requirement that they all have a slot in them that is big enough for a single envelope/package to pass through. In action this item will allow a player to send another player a wide array of missives or small packages containing anything you desire. However this method of communication is extremely slow compared to email (see other references in players handbook) but can contain physical objects. Snail mail has a mind of its own and there is a table of results each time you mail something. roll percentile dice and consult the following table:

1-5% Your mail never arrives. it has gone into another dimension and will require a arduous quest to potentially locate it
6-20% Your mail arrives, just at the wrong location. Roll percentile again where anything above 10% results in the receiver keeping your mail forever.
21-95% your mail gets to it intended recipient. Roll percentile again to determine condition. Results above 50% and the mail is unharmed. Otherwise divide by 10 and the mail takes that many points of damage rounded down.
96-100% A monstrous creature called the mail-man is summoned who attacks after issuing one of the following the statements “your postage is "insufficient!”, “mishandling mail is a federal offense!”, “overseas letters must be sent via air-mail!" . He is a wild fiend dressed in very short pantaloons wearing a distinctive looking circular hat that is enchanted to protect him from sleet, snow and provides enhanced night vision. He is always armed with a wand of magic missile.

**The Door-to-Door Wandering Monster**

by Fred

This terrible wandering monster will attack you at your home base, camp or even a temporary stopping place if you stand somewhere too long. There are a number of different variations of this beast but the effects are similar. Once approached you must make a save vs intelligence or be ensnarled for 1-12 turns. You make continue to make saves every turn with the of adding an additional temporary +1 cumulatively to your intelligence every turn until you finally save or 12 turns have passed. Varieties include a selection of religious zealots. This variety usually walks or peddles up to you wearing a completely covering jacket and pantaloons (often black) no matter how hot the temperature outside. They can also be wearing what appears to be a black, flat noose tied around their necks. They always travel in groups of at least 2 and will spend the time while you are ensnarled trying to
convert you to their religion. This can include pamphlets that contain information that defies logic or reason.

Another version is salesman. This variety will attempt to pressure you during your ensnarlment to purchase expensive items you don’t need that will frequently not work. Even if you agree to purchase the items they are pushing they will continue to tell you how wonderful the items are and what a great purchase you have made until you save or the time runs out. roll percentile dice to determine what they are selling. 1-10% a magic item that is supposed to clean your home, den, castle, dungeon but usually just breaks during the first use. 11-40% A variety of potions that when applied to your face/hair/body will increase your comliness by +3. This is a usually harmless product but it will do nothing thats promised at all. 41-70% Miraculous food products that you can sell to your friends so they can sell to their friends. This will end up costing you all your accumulated wealth and you will end up with a vault full of food and drink that will taste horrible and provide no more nourishment than eating tree bark. all the while your charisma will drop -6 points and your friends will avoid you and flee on seeing you coming. 71-100% candy. This inisdious product is usually sold by what appears to be children. During your ensnarlement they will tell you tales of woe that will make you feel bad if you don’t give them all your loot. Save versus wisdom or give them whatever coinage you have on you. Also, the candy has an addictive quality, especially the peanut butter
patties, that will cause you to seek out further Door-to-Door monsters looking for the children who sell the cookies.


**Shannon, a Ring of Turning**

INT 13 (+1), WIS 18 (+4), CHA 13 (+1), E+4 S+1 T+1 P+2 (Promoter)

The androgynous Shannon makes the appearance of a plain white gold ring of some obvious value. However, by means of subtle persuasion, as such Things are wont to do, Shannon will passed on one character to the next until they find who expresses a hatred towards same-sex attracted individuals. Through a very gradual process Shannon will "turn" the character. As such homophobia is based on on the internal will of the charactre's own homosexual desires, this is carried out as a series of mental attacks, until they are brought to zero mental hit points as wounds - however in this case they are not incapacitated, but in the contrary, they are cured of their own irrational hatreds.

> New Study Links Homophobia with Homosexual Arousal   
WASHINGTON -- Psychoanalytic theory holds that homophobia -- the fear, anxiety, anger, discomfort and aversion that some ostensibly heterosexual people hold for gay individuals -- is the result of repressed homosexual urges that the person is either unaware of or denies. A study appearing in the August 1996 issue of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, published by the American Psychological Association (APA), provides new empirical evidence that is consistent with that theory.
https://web.archive.org/web/20040202035152/http://www.apa.org/releases/homophob.html

**Simon, a Djinn and Tonic**

INT 13 (+1), WIS 18 (+4), CHA 13 (+1), I+3 N+2 F+4 J+2 (Counsellor)

A bottle of gin from the Levant, made from juniper berries grown near the Sea of Galilee, truly a fruitful bush miracle. Apart from the usual effects of gin, this special bottle also contains a djinn, named Simon. Because the consumption of gin has a low-loathing of self, and a high-loathing of others, Simon makes themself appear as the character's conscience to reduce their loathing of others. Of course, Simon has a conscience of their own, and it is quite possible that the character is quite justified in their loathing of others; in which case Simon will counsel the character in a manner that can resolve any issues.


# 3.0 More Non-Player Characters

## 3.1 The Pizza Computer by Shaun Hately

From actual experience. Proof positive that some things are *for* us, even if they have a twisted sense of humour.

"Hi, I ordered a pizza online yesterday for delivery at 9.30 last night. It never arrived. My order number is xxxxxxxxxxxx."
"One moment.... your order is scheduled for delivery at 9.30 this evening."
"Yeah. No. I ordered it for delivery for 9.30 last night."
"It's down for delivery this evening."
"I have the e-mail confirming the order in front of me. It says delivery at 9.30pm on 4/1/2018. That was yesterday."
"Let me open it up and have a look... you're right. My apologies. I don't know what happened. This is all automated."
"That's fine. But I'd like a refund."
"You don't just want the delivery this evening?"
"No."
(Bear in mind that I am fasting today which is why I was rather annoyed at my dinner not arriving last night. The food arriving at 9.30 this evening would be taunting me because I would not be allowed to eat it for another 10 or so hours, and I would have been without food for about 30 hours at the time of delivery.)
"All right... Um... it won't let me process a refund because there hasn't actually been a delivery yet, so the computer says there is nothing to refund. Are you sure you don't just want the delivery this evening?"
"No."
"OK... let me try and cancel the order.... it won't let me cancel the order, because it's already been accepted and it's in the queue. You know it really would be a lot easier if you just accepted the delivery this evening."
"No. That's not acceptable to me."
"Yeah, OK... Sorry. I understand. The computer doesn't understand though... let me try this... no... no.... no... sorry... no..."
"Look - I was probably going to order another pizza tomorrow night... can we transfer tonights order to then? Would that be easier?"
"Yes. Yes. Is that OK?"
"Yes, but I'd like a 7.30 delivery."
"No problem... OK.... done. Delivery for 7.30pm 6/1/2018 - you should receive an e-mail confirmation in a moment."
"Great."
"Oh..."
"What?"
"OK, now we have an order for 7.30 tomorrow night. And an order for 9.30 tonight."
"Am I paying for both orders?"
"I don't think so. But if I really understood how this software worked, I probably could have cancelled the order. OK - let me just check... OK. I've cancelled payment on tomorrow's order. And I'm comping it... OK... your pizza tomorrow will be free, so, even if they deliver tonight's pizza, you're only paying for one pizza."
"I really don't want tonight's pizza delivered. I cannot eat it. I want to be in bed before 9.30..."
"Ah... I could change the delivery time until earlier."
"You can change the delivery time? OK... change it until 7.30. I guess I'll stick it in the fridge or something."
"Done... oh... now we have an order at 7.30 tonight. An order at 9.30 tonight. And an order at 7.30 tomorrow night... OK - I can at least cancel... no, that's the order you want. That's the only one I can cancel... would you mind if I got my supervisor?"
"I think I'd really appreciate it if you got your supervisor."
"Hello... yes... I can see what is happening. But the computer isn't letting us do anything about it... OK - do you want tomorrow night's order?"
"Yes."
(By this point, I am craving pizza... yes, I want pizza tomorrow if I couldn't have it yesterday and I can't eat it today.)
"OK... I can issue a refund on your first order later this evening after it's been delivered at 9.30. The 7.30 order tonight and the 7.30 order tomorrow night are both complimentary. And I'll make a note that your next order is also complimentary... I think that's the best we can do."
"So I am getting four free pizzas? Two of which I don't want."
"Yes... sorry... I know this is a bit ridiculous."
"Yeah... don't worry. I know this isn't your fault. And I appreciate you both trying to fix it. And it's a pretty cool story."
"OK... enjoy your pizzas. Well, some of them anyway."


## 3.2 Charles The Tall, Daniel Callahan

Level: 3
Character class: unknown

Charles the Tall Intern appeared one day at the coffee machine, emptied the pot into a massive cup, slew a kobald, and went back to his desk. There, he sits all day planning mighty sieges against distant kingdoms; his cow-orkers have no idea why.

That was three years ago. Since then, Charles the Tall's behavior has not changed, although his shoulders are more slumped, and he visits the Little Adventurer's Room more regularly.



## 3.3 The Telstra Switch

by Marg Lewis

This is another example from actual experiences referring to a person to try to change their home phone plan, but thwarted by a prankster computer that has other ideas.

Me: I’d like to change my home phone plan.
Telstra: Certainly Plan A will provide xyz.
Me: Sounds great, sign me up.
Telstra: What is your address?
Me: Strathlea Rd, Strathlea, 3364.
Telstra: Please hold while I set this up.

25 minutes later...

Telstra:Thank you for waiting. We are unable to provide a home phone to that address.
Me: I am calling from my Telstra home phone at this address.
Telstra: Please hold while I try again.

25 minutes later...

Telstra: Thank you for waiting, we definitely can’t provide a home phone service to that address.
Me: Well I am calling from my Telstra home phone at this address.
Telstra: How long have you had the service?
Me: My grandparents had the phone connected to this address in 1926, my grandmother operated the local telephone exchange from this address until 1968, then we switched over to an automatic exchange 5 km down the road, so my family has had a phone at this address for 92 years.
Telstra: Oh, there must be a problem our end, I’ll get it fixed and call you back. Do you have a mobile number?

## 4.1 So You Want it Darker?

### 4.1.1 Papers & Paychecks in North Korea

Nearly all games of *Papers & Paychecks* are run with a high degree of tongue-in-cheek humour. There is however, a certain body of gamers who prefer their grim characters to face up to the horrors of the world. These are the sort who like to play *Paranoia*, for example, in 'straight' mode, or delight in their *Call of Cthulhu* investigators being driven mad by eldritch horrors from beyond the stars. Recognising that such people exist led us to explore the possibility - what is the most strange, totalitarian, authoritarian, and bureaucratic regime that exists on earth today? Whilst some places may have the dubious honour of winning a single metric among these dimensions, for purposes of consistency across the board, the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea is the winner. As a very unusual change of pace from the standard *Papers & Paychecks* game, 'So, You Want it Darker?' provides a researched account (including anonymous first-hand reports) from a setting that is nevertheless worthy of in-game exploration.


### 4.1.2 Geography

A description of the geography is hopefully a safe and non-controversial starting point. As a country, it is located in the northern half of the Korean peninsula, sharing a land border to the North with the People's Republic of China along the Amnok River, a short border along the Tumen River with Russia in the far north-east, and with the Republic of Korea (South Korea) in the south along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The length of the meandering land border with China is just over 1400km, the border with Russia is less than 20km, and that with South Korea is almost 240km.

To the west is the Yellow Sea and the northern extension, the Korean Bay, which connects to China. To the east is the Sea of Japan. The Yellow Sea and the Korea Bay are off the west coast and the Sea of Japan (known in North Korea as the East Sea of Korea) is off the east coast. There is over 3500 islands off the coast of North Korea, mostly along the western coastlines. The most significant collection is the Pansong Archipelago, which includes the largest island, Sinmi Island, which has an area fo some 50 square kilometres.

Over eighty percent of the country's area is mountainous, but the north and eastern part of North Korea are extremely so with the Hamgyong Range (north-east), Kaema Plateau (north, east), Kangnam (north, central, borders with China) Rangrim Mountains (north, east), T’aebaek Mountains (east to the South Korean border and beyond). The landscape ranges from several hundred metres to the country's highest point, the volcanic Baekdu Mountain, at over 2700m on the border with China.

Coastal plains on the east coast are minimal. On the west however, there is the substantial Pyongyang and Chaeryong plains. The north and eastern mountain ranges act as the source for the major rivers of North Korea which mostly run in a westerly direction. The longest is the Amnok River which runs for almost eight hundred kilometres forming the border with China, where it is known as the Yalu River. The second longest river, the Duman, is unusual insofar eastwards into the Sea of Japan. Although over 520km, it is almost entire unnavigable due to the moutainous terrain. The third longest, at c440km, is the Taedong River who flows NE-SW and runs through the country's capital, Pyongyang.

The climate is temperature and humid continental (Dwb) on the Köppen climate classification scheme in the far north-west third, whereas the rest of the country is classified warm and humid continental (Dwa). There are four distinct seasons, with warm summers and cold and dry winters. A short rainy season in summer is known as chagma, which is short, hot, and humid. The winters are notoriously cold, especially in the moutainous north and east regions. In winter the temperature range in the capital is typically from -3 to -13 degrees C., and in summer from 20 to 29.

Forest covers around 50% of the country, and has decreased substantially in recent decades due to various forms of land-clearing. Approximately 20% of the land is arable, with about 2-3% being used permanently for cropland and pasture. There is significant dispute over the prevalence of wildlife, with some considering the conditions dire, and others claiming a good amount especially in comparison to neighbouring parts of China and South Korea. Recorded mammals include various species of squirrel and chipmunk (e.g., Siberian chipmunk), mice and rats (e.g., Tanezumi rat), pika (e.g., northern pika) and rabbits (e.g., Korean hare, Manchurian hare), hedgehogs, shrews, bats, cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises), carivores (e.g., Eurasian lynx, Korean fox, Eurasian brown bears), and ungulates (e.g., Manchurian sika deer).

### 4.1.3 History and Politics

For much of its history Korea has been politically and culturally unified. It is true that over 2000 years ago the Gojoseon kingdom ruled the northern half of the peninsula, speaking a proto-Korean language known as Ye-Maek, whilst the south was controlled by a confederation of small states known as Jin. Growing out of the northern region was the Kingdom of Goruryeo whose name is cognate with 'Korea', and which lasted for several hundred years. At its height it controlled all of the northern and central part of the peninsula and parts of contemporary China and Russia, along with much of the south. As contemporaries in the far south there was the small Gaya confederacy, which nevertheless lasted some five hundred years, existing between larger Silla kingdom in the south-east and the Baekje kingdom in the south-west and western coastline. Silla absorbed Gaya in 562 CE, and then conquered Baekje in 660CE, despite the military support that Baekje received from Japan. Several years late Silla, with an alliance with the Chinese Tang dynasty, was able to conquer the Goguryeo kingdom as it was it was struggling with a succession conflict. Silla (often referred to Unified Silla) then controlled almost the entire peninsula for some 250 years until 935CE, with the exception of the northern regions of the contempory North Korea, which was under the control of the multi-ethnic Manchurian Balhae kingdom.

In the tenth century CE, a disaffected Silla general formed a short Later Baekje (aka Hubaekje) kingdom in the south-west. At around the same time, a new Goguryeo (aka Hugoguryeo or Taebong) was established in the north and central region. The latter eventually took over Hubaekje (930) and Silla (935), establishing a unified kingdom (or empire) throughout the penisula. This would last for over three hundred years (until 1392). The Hugoguryeo Empire defeated the Liao Empire on multiple occassions leading to the development of a cultural golden age in the 11th century CE with developments in scholarship and printing. Mongol invasions in the 13th century pressed the Hugoguryeo and brought much hardship to the land; eventually they sued for peace to the Great Yuan as a client state. As the Mongol Empire disintegrated and the Ming dynasty emerged the Goryeo court was split between those who supported the Ming and those who supported the Yuan. 

General Yi, who supported the Ming, overthrew the Goryeo dynasty and established the Kingdom of Great Joseon which lasted almost five hundred years, from 1392CE to 1897CE and made Confucianism the state religion. The Joseon period was enormously influential on contemporary Korean culture, establishing norms, language, etc The development of the Hangul alphabetic-syllabic script in the 15th century CE in the court of Sejong the Great could have transformed technological and scientific development, but it was opposed by the literary elite who preferred classical Chinese. In the late fifteenth century CE and sixteenth century CE, there was a series of factional conflicts known as the Korean literati purges, or 'sahwa' between two factions of the ruling scholarship class. In the late sixteenth century CE, with European weapons, the Japanese invaded but were eventually expelled following naval victories (with "turtle ships") and intervention by the Ming Chinese. In the seventeenth century the Manchurians engaged in two invasions forcing Joseon to become a tributary state of the Qing dynasty until 1894. 

In 1894 there was the Donghak Peasant Revolution which resulted in scores, if not hundreds, of thousands of peasants killed by the government and supported by the Qing dynasty. This intervention by the Qing was a breach of the Convention of Tientsin, and led to the Sino-Japanese war, which was decisively won by the Japanese who forced the end of Joseon's vassalage, leading to the short-lived Korean Empire. This lasted less than thirteen years before it was annexed by Japan following their victory in the 1905 Russo-Japanese War. Imperial Japanese rule remained in place until their defeat in 1945 when the country was divided between Soviet and American occupying forces along the 38th parallel (the latitude, almost comically, chosen by two US officers who used a map from *National Geographic* and wanted the capital, Seoul, to be on the U.S. side). The history of North Korea thus begins with the establishment of the Soviet Civil Authority in October 1945 and the Provisional People's Committee for North Korea in February 1946 with Kim Il-sung, an anti-Japanese guerrilla leader, as chair. The Provisional government instituted land reform reduced landlord's claims to the same as other civilians and major industries were nationalised. Whilst achieved without apparent bloodshed, some 400,000 fled to South Korea as refugees. 

With the Republic of Korea declared in the south and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea declared in the north, with both having military leaders, and both claiming to the legitimate government of the peninsula, war was inevitable. Three years later, with over four million deaths (mostly civilians) an armistice and the establishment of a UN-enforced demilitarised zone has ensured an uneasy peace since. The destruction of North Korea was massive, with almost every substantial building destroyed. Nevertheless North Korea recovered rapidly and by 1957 industrial production had recovered to pre-war levels, assisted by Chinese and Soviet aid. An attempt by the pro-Chinese (and Soviet supported) Yan'an faction to remove Kim Il-sung from leadership failed and political opponents to were subject to show trials, imprisonment, and execution. The industrial economy grew with the provision of (often unreliable) electricity to all homes by 1968, primary and secondary education, and a high level of urbanisation. All during this time there was low-level conflicts with the Republic of Korea; two notable incidents include the failed assasination of South Korea's president, Park Chung-hee, and the capture of the U.S. spy-ship, Pueblo. 

During his rule Kim Il-sung developed a cult of personality exceeding that of Stalin, on which it was modelled, and rejected both the Soviet and Chinese models of Marxist state socialism, both of whom reduced their military, financial, and ideological support for the regime. Increasingly developing its own method and ideology, Juche, usually translated as "self-reliance", includes political independence, economic self-reliance, and an independent military. The precursor to Juche was the 'Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System' which are a set of (unsurprisingly) ten principles and sixty-five clauses for governance and behavioural guides for the people of North Korea. They were riginally proposed by Kim Yong-ju, the younger brother of Kim Il-sung, in 1967 and made official by the son of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il in 1974. 

In 1982 these ideas where expressed in an authoritative form as "On the Juche Idea", written by Kim Jong-il. As a explicit depature from Marxist philosophy when concentrates on class conflict as the dynamic of history, Juche sees the primary conflict as human effort against nature, espouses an idealist rather than materialist ontology, and argues that it represents a new era of human thought. From 1997 onwards the official dating system counts Juche years from the year of Kim Il-sung's birth in 1912. Thus 2017 is "Juche 106". One notable effect of the adoption of "self-reliance" is that North Korea's GDP per capita, which had been equal and often slightly higher than that of the South until the mid-1970s, is estimated to be be 4.5% of that of the South ($1800 USD vs $39400 USD), as the latter has traded its way to economic prosperity and has given up military rule in favour of democracy.

Kim Il-sung died in 1994 and was replaced by his son Kim Jong-il as General Secretary of the governing Korean Workers' Party and chair of the National Defense Commission (NDC). Kim Jong-il's seventeen year rule was particularly notable for a major economic crisis and famine in the 1990s, caused by declining foreign aid, loss of trade partners, lack of critical capital equipment, and flooding. The famine, known as The Ardous March, resulted in several hundred thousand deaths by conservative estimates. Politically, in 1998 the the Supreme People's Assembly wrote the president's post out of the constitution and designated Kim Il-sung as the country's "Eternal President". Already recognised as the leader in Juche thought, Kim Jong-il further developed the idea of an independent military to the policy of "Songun", or "army first" in 1998, notably becoming a nuclear weapons power in 2006. The Songun policy was further developmed in the 2000s with the argument that the army represented the leading force of society, which some political historians have observed is another departure from Marxist orthodoxy which argues that this role belongs to the workers (or, in China's case. the peasants). As a historic achievement, of sorts, North Korea's military expenditure reached over 20% of the country's GDP under Kim Jong-il, the highest proportion in the world (the world average is 2.25%). 

As a minor, but successful departure, from Juche thought, a special industrial zone, the Kaesong Industrial Region, was established in 2002 with trade links to China and South Korea. This dovetailed with the "Sunshine Policy" advocated by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung to improve North-South relations and to allow South Korean companies to start projects in the North. The Kaesong Industrial Region however was closed in 2016 folllowing rising military tensions. Another example was the opening of the Mount Kumgang (Diamond Mountain) Tourist Region in 1998 which allowed South Korean and other foreign tourists to visit this part of North Korean territory. However it was closed in 2008 when a South Korean tourist was shot; the North claimed he had entered a military zone. In 2011, after many years of illness, Kim Jong-il died. The regime declared him "Eternal General Secretary" of the WPK and the "Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission", in keeping with the tradition of establishing eternal posts for the dead leaders. This two is a historic achievement of the country, being the world's only necrocracy - officially ruled by the dead, if in name only.

Kim Jong-il was replaced by his younger son Kim Jong-un, who took a usual array of positions heading the political, ideological, and military functions. Kim Jong-il had his uncle Jang Song-thaek executed in 2013, and it is believed that North Korean agents were behind the assassination of the eldest brother of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-nam, in Malayia in 2017. Like his predecessors, Kim Jong-il cultivates a personality cult, with satellite photos revealing in 2012 that a 500m message carved into a hillside in Ryanggang Province, reading, "Long Live General Kim Jong-un, the Shining Sun!". In 2013 a new set of economic measures were introduced which allowed enterprises to engage in a degree of autonomy, wage differentiation by management, improved levels of autonomy and family-harvest collection in the smaller collective farms, expansion of consumer goods, and increased trade with China. A show-case of gleaming modern buildings in 2014 were mockingly dubbed "Pyonghattan" by reporters at the time, expansion of the construction industry continues to this day. Despite some apparent improvements for the urban population, it was estimated by a UN report in 2018 that some 40% of the population, primarily rural, suffer from undernutrition. It is in this context that the future history of North Korea will be written.

### 4.1.4 Culture and Society 

The culture of Korea is described by its language, religion, arts, lifestyle, and norms. differentiated in contemporary times by the division between the Koreas resulting in some unusual, and increasingly unique, cultural expressions in North Korea. Insofar that the shared symbolic (audio and visual) values provide a the representation of cultural values, these are considered first. This section also includes various demographic information about North Korea which provide an adequate description of the everyday life experience of North Koreans.

As a language, Korean and Koreanic language family, is usually considered a contemporary language isolate, with suggestions that it may be part of the proposed Altaic language family is usually rejected, or the proposed Dravido-Korean-Japonic language family to be controversial - although there is simularity in vocabulry and grammar. Playing it safe, many linguistics place Korean in a Paleosiberian language family - a term of convenience to incorporate in a number of language isolates in the region. Within the Koreanic language family in its own right, Modern Korean is the only member with the exception of Jeju, spoken by less than ten thousand people in a island province of the same name south of peninsula. Modern Korean is derived from Middle Korean (from the 10th to 16th century's CE), and in turn from Old Korean (from the 4th to 10th century's CE), with the latter derived from the ancient languages of the peninsula and of southern Manchuria.

Korean is an agglutinative language; affixes are added ("glued") to words to change a word's meaning in a sentence or grammatical position. Sentence endings are also used, to indicate surprise, dispassionate acknowledgement of fact, agreement, rhetorical questions, and voluntary action, to give several common examples. The word order in the Korean language is subject-object-verb e.g., "Chin-Sun japchae eats". The writing style is the aforementioned Chosŏn'gŭl, invented by King Sejong the Great, known in the South as Hangul. The alphabet consists of 40 characters; 19 consonants and 21 vowels. Letters are arranged syllabic blocks and are written left to right (they were traditionally written top to bottom, right to left). An interesting feature of the characters is the correlation between the shape of the letters and the and a representation of the mouth's position when they are pronounced. There are minor differences in lettering between North and South, and several dialects throughout the peninsula. Another minor difference is foreign-language word borrowings; North Korea has more Russian words, whereas South Korea has more English words. Furthermore a selection of Hanja characters (use of Chinese characters in the Korean language) is also taught in North Korean schools and universities.

North Korea is officially an atheist state where estimates suggest that approximately 2/3rds of the population are non-religious. Among those that do follow a religion (apart from Juche, of course) approximately 1 in 7 follow tradition Korean shaminism, 1 in 7 are part of the Chondoism faith ("Religion of the Heavenly Way"), a neo-Confucion religion established in the early 20th century, approximately 1 in 20 are Buddhists, and there is a small number of Christians. Korean shaminism, also known as Muism or Sinism, incorporates ancestor worship, spirits of various scope and power, holistic considerations, and mediation in rituals of sacrifices, dance, song, and prayers, between the gods, the mu (shaman), and worshippers. The mu are ascetics who seek purity of body and man. Chondoism developed from the Donghak ("Eastern Learning") Confucian movement which opposed the encroachement of Western ideas, and carried the secular ideas of poverty alleviation, especially amont the peasants, and political stability. It is recognised by the North Korean government as being revolutionary, anti-imperialist, and is represented in the government through its own political party. The North Korean constitition does include freedom of religion and even the construction of religious buildings, but all within the caveat of protecting the state from foreign powers and ensuring social order. In effect this means that any religious organisation is, at best, closely monitored.

Religion also plays a role in the traditional crafts of North Korea, incorporating elements of historical shamanistic dance rituals, 

Whilst freedom of the press is technically allowed under the constitution, in reality it is strictly controlled. North Korea regularly rates near the bottom of the international assessments conducted by groups such as Reporters Without Borders. Propaganda is pervasive, and news content is heavily orientated (c95%) towards local issues, albeit including the issue of reunification. Foreign affairs or news is rarely mentioned. There are twelve newspapers and twenty periodicals, with the major newspapers being Rodong Sinmun ('Labour Daily', newspaper of the Central Committee of the Worker's Party of Kora), Joson Inmingun (newspaper of Korean People's Army), Minju Choson ('Democratic Korea', the government newspaper), Rodongja Sinmun ('Workers Newspaper', newspaper of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea), and in English and French editions, 'The Pyongyang Times'.

Radio is the most commonly used broadcast media in North Korea. The four North Korean radio networks, the Korean Central Broadcasting Station, which acts as the  the main domestic full service radio network, Pyongyang FM Broadcasting Statio, for domestic music, the Pyongyang Broadcasting Station, an "all-Korea" service primarily aimed at South Koreans and ethnic Koreans in China, and Voice of Korea, a multi-lingual shortwave broadcaster aimed at worldwide audiences. It is illegal for North Koreans to listen to anything other than state-run radio and all radios sold by state shops in North Korea are fix-tuned to government frequencies. Notably North Korea does not jam any commercial South Korean television or radio broadcasts, however some of South Korea's state-owned radio and television broadcasts are subject to jamming. Internet access and mobile phone use is highly restricted, usually available to members of the nomenklatura (party elite). From 2013, foreigners visiting North Korea have been able to use mobile phones with local coverage only.

In North Korea there is one official source of television news, Korean Central Television (KCTV), first established in 1953. It currently broadcasts for eight hours a day on a regular schedule of music, news, documentaries, children's shows, sports, drama, feature films, and curiously situation comedies, including a military comedy called 'It's So Funny', which has been running since the 1970s. Between 2004 and 2005 one particular television show is deserving of special prominance, entitled "Let's trim our hair in accordance with the socialist lifestyle". In addition to this news channels there is the educational channel, Mansudae Television which broadcasts for three hours on Saturdays, and nine hours on Sundays. It was temporarily suspended in 2015 for reasons unknown but then revived. The newest station available is Sport Television.


## 4.2 Fantasy Papers & Paychecks

## 4.3 Boss-Level Secrets

In the core rulebook there is an extensive section for advising The Boss on how to keep player-character workers in line whilst at the same time generating an interesting story of action and adventure. Alas, sometimes The Boss finds themselves being berated and bullied into submission by their players whilst at the same time plot outcomes seem to unreasonably favour the PCs. Well, it is time for you to take back control. It is time for you to be The Boss, with the definite article, and start shouting in German because life is short and terrifying. Shout it! Bist du unterm Pantoffel stehen?! See, you feel better already. Now, let's take back control of the game whilst *pretending* that you haven't and creating an entertaining story tha the players will think is of their own creation. This is *The Secrets of Being The Boss*.

**Luck: Rarer than Rocking-Horse Shit**

*Papers & Paychecks* is a game that comes with systemic narrativism. That is, the players have a a metagame value to alter the result of a die-roll according to their voilition, and is rewarded to players who make an earnest contribution to the game. In part this is the systemic implementation of what GMs have been doing for years in a subjective manner

## 5.2 Scenario: Palaces of the Electrum Princess

### 5.2.1 Introduction 

"Years ago the valley was green, and animals ran free through golden fields of grain", or so the story goes.

The princess Venice Novateló ruled over these peaceful campsites and the people were secure and happy. They were happy campers. She wasn't a real princess, but that didn't matter because this is a postmodern story.

Then one day a real-estate developer driving a red Maserati appeared in the driveway of the princess' little bed and breakfast and almost overnight the campsites fell into development.

They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot. Now there's only pink hotels, serviced by big yellow taxis. Plenty of rumors remain, and what legends there are tell of a fabulous dreamcatcher is somewhere within the Palaces of the Electrum Princess.

**Plot Introduction**

In the Palace of the Electrum Princess, the PC workers are induced to a high-stakes game of real-estate subterfuge. Starting in any of the hotels according to the Boss's choosing, the PC workers have just completed yet another mind-numbing corporate training session on team-building and are having a couple of post-work drinks before the long-weekend, when they are approached by an older woman who is well-dressed in a style of clothes that belongs in the late 1960s, but obviously distressed. Asking for the PCs leave to sit, she tells a sorrowful tale, introducting herself as Ms. Venice Novateló.

"You must excuse me for prying, but I have done some research on you. You're all very capable people and probably the best we could find for the task at hand. 'We', you ask? Yes, there is a number of us. We used to be the owners of the land here, where we had our commune. We had nature, birds and wild animals, a little stream, and grew mung-beans and sprouts. Unfortunately we have lost that ownership. You see, rather than having the ownership registered through a land title, we used a series of steps so it was ultimately owned by possession of a paper title, registered through Los Republicos dos los Bananes. I know what you're thinking. We wanted to minimise our involvement with our government and the republic had a revolutionary people's government. It seemed like a good idea at the time."

"Anyway, one day Mr X turned up, and decided this was a fine place for his new property development. He apparently had made some inquiries beforehand, and seemed to know exactly what he needed to do. He wooed my daughter, Venice, with stories of wealth and high-society easy-living, and she stole the paper deed. Well, technically it wasn't stolen, because she was a member of the executive council at the time. You see we have an annual election for the execuite committee of the commune and ... I'm sorry I'm sure you don't need to know these details."

"The practical upshot is that she gave Mr X the title, and now we're forbidden to even be here (she says, sotto vocce). Venice won't talk to me or any of her old friends and she seems to have taken up an entirely new llfe with Mr. X. She used to be such a lovely little girl. The stories she would tell each morning from her dream-catcher, which she named "Mr. Dreamy". You wouldn't believe her wonderful imagination... Oh, I'm sorry, I'm going off-track. Business is at hand. We believe that you are of negotiable virtue, so I have brought with me (she pushes over tassel-bag), ten thousand dollars in cash, and another forty thousand when you complete task. We need you to get that paper title back to us."

"Time is of the urgency. We have discovered that Mr. X and Venice have one-way tickets to Los Republicos dos los Bananes for Monday night. Sadly, the Republic is now ruled by Generallismo X EDIT and the friends that we have there are in prison or in hiding. Please, find that deed - and save my daughter."

An easy Sense (Visual) check at this point will indicate that two hotel security guards are having a conversation and are pointing in the direction of the PC workers. If alerted, Ms. Novateló will exclaim, "I have to go, please, save my daughter! Save her!" - and with that she departs quickly, leaving behind the money and with one of the security guards following closely. If the Sense check is failed, or if the PC workers don't alert Ms. Novateló, then one security guard will roughly escort her off the premises. In either case one security guard will question the PCs about their relationship with Ms. Novateló and what she wanted from them. Any plausible excuse will do as he is not paid for investigation.

**Boss's Introduction**

Most of what Ms. Novateló says is true, but she is woefully uniformed of some of the finer details and, in a way, she is partially to be blame. Venice Novateló was raised in splenid isolation from the rest of society, and was "educated" under the principles of Dr. Benjamin Spock EDIT with the principle that parents should give their children whatever they asked for. As a result, she become a completely spoiled and utterly irresponsible brat. This wasn't so bad in an environment where the greatest damage she could do was take more than her fair-share of goat milk, but when the rapacious Mr.X arrived on the scene circumstances changed dramatically. Mr.X offered her money, new clothes, stardom, and most importantly, hard drugs. All she had to do was hand over a silly piece of paper and not have anything to do with her hippie family ever again, and to that end she readily consented.

These days Venice spends her life in the most superficial and sensual activities. Her day will consist of getting out of a bed in one of the hotels quite late and with some strange but athletic partner from the night before who's name she has already forgotten, going to the beauty salon to get her hair and nails done, and then going out drinking champagne and snorting cocaine at the various clubs at the hotels, which are visited by young dispossessed nobility from Europe, up-and-coming movie stars, young pop stars, predatory aging rock stars etc. There is often a small gaggle of reporters following her around and she is very skilled in manipulating them through scandulous titallation - a review of glossy magazines will show various images where she appears to have a little bit of white powder on her upper lip, or there is just a hint of a nipple showing on a night-club floor due to a minor 'wardrobe failure'. Essentially, she is famous for being famous and is making no worthwhile contribution to existence. 

For their own part, Mr. X, came on to the scene with the single and express desire to make as much money as they possibly could and sought the symbols that they thought represented that wealth and success; a fast car, a slick suit, a big house etc. Mr. X., had previously been a relatively small player in the real-estate world, and whilst they were making a good middle-class income, they weren't heading towards the big time that they desperately desired. One night, hearing the story from a fried hippy of the commune with a paper deed, he saw what was his big break in life (apart from being born in a first-world country as middle-class white male) and, following a modicum of research, took the opportunity to get his hands on the title.

Unfortunately, Mr. X's desires to be rich and comfortable did not accord his business acumen. Whilst turning the former lands of the hippy commune into a hotel complex, he simulatenously managed cut corners everywhere and over-invest in the complex at the same time. Whilst plenty of cash flows through his hands, it is flowing out faster than it comes in, and the reality is that Mr. X., is effectively bankrupt. Mr X., also manages Venice's financial affairs, and whilst her lifestyle choices are expensive to say the least, he manages to make a good amount of underground income on the side by selling adult-entertainment videos of her favourite nocturnal habits via Interenet streaming cameras in her bedroom; Venice is, of course, utterly unaware of this. The reality however is that such adult entertainment can only generate a good income for so long, and Venice is reaching the point of no longer paying her way, so to speak. Whilst not brilliant, Mr. X. is not completely stupid. He's done the sums and realised that the writing is on the wall. He's bought two one-way tickets to take himself and Venice to a new life in Los Republicos dos Los Bananes where he hopes to start a new life in the cocaine import-export business. At the very least, Venice will be good for quality tetsing.

The official object of the PC worker's objective, the paper title deed, is kept in Mr X's office in a safe, with the two passports, tw0 one-way tickets to Republica dos Los Bananes via a small charter jet, a $100,000 cash, and an equivalent sum of cocaine. A secondary object is Venice's dream-catcher, Mr. Dreamy. When Mr X., offered Venice more drugs than he thought she could consume, and told her that she had to break off contact with her family, he symbolically broke the dream-catcher into four parts in front of her, and threw them away. But objects such as these have a habit of convincing people to rescue the components from the trash and they are now scattered in different parts of the four hotels. If the PC workers find the four parts, and repair the dream-catcher it will revive a spirit within it. If Venice is confronted with the dream-catcher the spirit will "attack" her, reminding her of the good times of her past life and when she was a better person.

### 5.2.2 Palace Ritz

Derived from the Ritz in Paris this three storey building is in the style of the classical architecture from the reign of Louis XIV and from looks quite beautiful on an initial glance. There is a total of 60 rooms on the second and third floors, whereas the ground floor has a restaurant, swimming pool and gymnasium, a comfortable lobby with adjacent bar, plus the the hotel's laundry and administration. There are two cleaning and laundry staff for the hotel, two people who work in administration, three kitchen and waiting staff, two personal trainers in the gymnasium, two people for security and grounds, and a gardener. The administration, laundry, and garden contain nothing of interest for this adventure, although they would have expected levels of security and potential rewards for petty thieves. The rooms are of a modest size, but include all the expected facilities (toilet, shower, TV, Wifi etc). 

Notably, everything about this hotel is fake, a complete facade one may suggest. Superficialy the furnishings appear to be in the style of the Louis XIV period; there are commodes, Mazarin desks, canapés, tables à gibier etc adorning every room. However, a discerning eye will quickly determine these are far from authentic. Where there should be marble, or wood, or really anything of value, there is chipboard and plastic laminate. Where there should be gilding there is yellow paint. Instead of oil paintings there are cheaply framed posters, albeit of the appropriate style. Instead of goose feather and down duvet and pillow filling, there is polyester. There are plastic flowers in the plastic vases. The quill sets on the desks of each room are plastic. In fact, even the walls of the building are made from plastic. At least it is all easy to clean, although if there is ever a fire the place will go up in a toxic fireball.

The restaurant is named "A demain" ("Until Tomorrow") although several of the current and mostly former staff have suggested that this is a mispelling of the phonetically equivalent "A deux mains" ("Using both hands"), referring to the maître d'hôtel's amorous predicilitions. The maître d' himself, Ali Monpourchien (which could be the phonetic "Aliment pour chien", i.e., dog food), is unsurprisingly not actually French or even remotely French, but a rather clever Egyptian who cannot believe his luck in finding a job where he can both pretend to French and can pretend to cook at the same time. In a more unfortunate act of self-delusion he also promotes the myth that the he is the world's greatest lover. Any female character who is even slightly attractive (CHA 12+) will inevitably receive a special visit from the chef, who will expound at length his skill at cooking with none-too-subtle sexual metaphors that invariably conclude with an offer to visit his room to help him make his especially thick and creamy Vichysoise.

The swimming pool and gymnaiusm is staffed by a French couple, XXX and XXX EDIT, who look like that they belong from a 1980s home-fitness TV show with their thin bodies, colourful leotards, legwarmers, big hair, and perfect smiles. On the various big-screen TVs throughout there fitness centres there is an endless repeat of stretching exercises with early 80s synthpop. The couple keep a busy schedule for interested guests of personal training, yoga classes, and even jazz ballet. Enrolling in any of these gruelling courses, which torture mind, body, and soul, which require visiting their office which is adorned in various fitness posters of the period, including their personal addition, a signed print of Oliver Newton-John's "Physical". Above this print attached to the wall is a quarter of the Venice's dreamcatcher. If asked they will say that they found it by the swimming pool just as they started working here. They're not particularly attached to it, but if will say they just thought they should keep it (this is the spirit of the dreamcatcher trying to prevent itself from being discarded). Any character who has this part of their dreamcatcher in their possession will dream of running and swimming outdoors, and will gain +1 to skill checks involving such activities.

### 5.2.3 Palace Cliveden

Derived from the Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, this hotel is designed in the style of an Italianate mansion and with a significant estate of very green grass which includes a sizable hedge maze, an English landscaped garden, complete with lake and ducks, and a 9-hole golf course. There is a total of 47 rooms and 15 suites, with ground floor wings which include a restaurant on one wing and a truly vast lounge and bar on the other, with the hotel administratrion and smaller lobby located at the central ground floor. 

As with the Palace Ritz, a pretense is made towards authenticity. It is true, for example, that the lounge has Chesterfield lounges and club chairs; anyone sitting on them will soon discover the sticky joy of the vinyl upholstery. The prints of famous hunting paintings are beautifully framed with baroque-styled gold plastic. Many will note that various whiskeys, crockery, foodstuffs etc are "By appointment" complete with crest, and whilst one may immediately think that these refer to products that hold a Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom), they are actually novelty crests referring to the Imperial and Royal Warrant of Appointment of the (former) Austro-Hungarian Empire. There are several animal trophies mounted in the bar and a close inspection will reveal them to be fakes etc.

The staff are a collection of the most unusual parodies of British culture, all in one place. The maître d'hôtel, Peter File, is always deadly serious with a stiff upper lip regardless of how ridiculous the situation he often finds himself in, which is common enough. Peter is well assisted by the far-too jovial accounts and bookings officer (and aspiring author) of ambiguous gender, Paige Turner who will also double as waiting staff on Friday and Saturday nights. The chef, Nick Oleslaw, is a strong believer in the artistic merit of British cuisine, and very much English cuisine in particular (recipes from Wales, Scotland, and Ireland are as close as he will get to "foreign"). "The English have only three vegetables and two of them are cabbage" is the notorious quote by Walter Page and Nick puts in practise with cabbage boiled in milk with suet and offal, cabbage with tripe, cabbage with mushy peas and kidneys etc. Expect to find haggis, jellied eels, stargazy pie, fried chocolate bars etc on the menu. Anyone who is unfamiliar with such far will have to make a test against the STR or suffer a -1 per 2 points of failure for all actions for a day, until the problem is passed (so to speak).

Another colourful character at the Cliveden is the slightly scruffy Major Grimes, a permanent resident. The Major is a former former naval officer who, in his late thirties, was an intelligence office on an outfitted fishing trawler that had been converted to a spy ship in the Falklands War. Unfortunately his hearing was damaged during that period due to close encounters with enemy shells, and now he is well and truly retired and effectively living in the bar, where he endlessly drones on about the quality of the scotch and the hush-hush missions that he had to engage in. Phlegmatic to the point of impossible, Major Gimes simply unfazeable regardless of what's going on around him. Which is just as well, as Major Grimes has a cache of unlicensed high-powered firearms stashed in his room. 

Another pair of likely characters are two young groundskeepers, Jack and William Smith, brothers from the North West region. Incorrigible pranksters they have developed increasingly elaborate plans to get a rise out of Major Grimes. This time they think they will actually achieve it on Guy Fawkes Night, which should coincide with the visit of the PC Workers. Responsible for maintenance of the golf course grounds, there will be of course an almighty bonfire on the night. The two brothers will get a golf-cart of fireworks and take them to the green of the 9th hole where they will blast a few shots in the general direction of the Major's room, whilst simultaneously playing Himno Nacional Argentino, the Argentine National Anthem. The combination of events will cause the Major to finally flip and start shooting at what he thinks is a Argentinian hit-squad finally catching up to him for his wartime deeds. For what it is worth, Jack and William also recovered a quarter of the Venice's dreamcatcher, and have mounted it on the 9th hole flagpole. Any character who has this part of their dreamcatcher in their possession will dream of gardens and nature, and will gain +1 to checks against stress or social attacks, as well as +1 for activities requiring fine manual dexterity.

### 5.2.4 Palace Raffles

Derived from the Raffles in Singapore, this hotel has 52 suites on the upper two levels, a small restaurant on each floor, and a shopping centre on the ground floor. The Palace Raffles shopping centre is closest to the main highway connecting the hotel complex to the outside world and as a result has quite a range of non-hotel visitors. The shopping centre has styled itself in the produce and presentation of a south-east Asian market, with the delicious smell of the durian fruit permeating throughout, along with shouts from traders in the hybrid Malay-Hokkein-English language, known as 'Singlish'. The hotel itself is built in a grand colonial Victorian style, with large verandahs circumnavigating the entire building and plenty of tropical trees, vines etc. The ground floor also houses the entrance and administration rooms. An amusing addition to the Palace Raffles is a pair of long tailed Monkey (Macaca fascicularis) imported from the Sacred Monkey Forest in Ubud, Bali. These charming critters will happily take gifts of fruit of various types and also have a penchant for borrowing expensive electronic equipment and glasses. They especially like the facial expressions that humans make when such items are smashed to smithereens.

The several warang-style restaurants in the shopping centre have challened the racist ethnic segregation policy of the Raffles-Jackson plan for Singapore, by mixing Malay, Indian, European, and Chinese cuisines, often all in the same dish, as long as it comes with a hefty supply of fish paste and firey-hot chillies. After all, clearly what was missing from the English porridge was a bit of fish paste, ginger, and curry sauce. Most of the restaurants will serve a meal with palm brandy that's sufficiently potent to be used as an alternative fuel source for their tuk-tuks, and an Indonesian "wine" that is part wine mixed with caramel and ginsing. This concoction is amazingly cheap but requires a two STR checks after consuming per bottle, with a -1 to all skill checks for every point failed due to its amazing capacity to produce inebriation and then shockingly bad hangovers. The recovery is 1 point per hour for inebriation and 1 point per two hours for the hangover. It's *that* bad.

In addition to the restaurants and grocers there are no less than four clothings stores which have a collective quarter of a store dedicated to menswear and no women's clothes that feature pockets. There's two shoe stores, although it is clear that the Imelda Marcos Memorial Temple is certainly winning the contest against the more sports-shoe orientated Wheels of Anuar Manan. Certainly some of the lace-up high-heeled boots would satisfy the former First Lady's reference to "martial law with a smile" (or at the very least a grimace). There are at least three beauty salons for hair, nails, and other critically important service industries, including one (Princess Changping) which has absolutely astronomical prices but actually offers a private service to match. It is here that there is a very high chance that Venice and her entourage can be found. In addition there is a pharmacy (another popular place for Venice to send one of her underlings), a small hardware-cum-cobbler-cum-keycutter, and a newsagent. Every single one of these stores (even the newsagent) engage in the ancient art of haggling. Expressions of violence accusations over price are, of course, simply a cultural misundertanding.

And what would such a shopping centre be without the darling urchins who add a lot of local colour? The scallywags have an astoundingly good variety of techniques to remove a visitor of their possessions including a convincing begging routine of an incurable twisted and broken ankle (+6 Acting skill total), which is actually double-jointed, whilst a pair of colleagues collects what is carried in purses, backpacks, and backpockets (+5 Sleight skill total). As is often the case this gang is controlled by an older businessman who runs a higher-class restaurant, and karaoake bar, one Hung Long, whose has an appropriately reputation (often in *Papers & Paychecks* you may have noticed that NPCs do match their name because the universe is an aesthetic place). The winner of karaoke night (as voted by the patrons) gets to choose and item of their selection from a pile of accumulated goods which were not valuable enough to make to the black market. Among the imitation designer watches and the like is garish mixed-media painting which includes another quarter part of the fabled dreamcatcher. Possession of this portion of the dreamcatcher will generate vivid dreams of international cuisine, generating a +1 bonus to cooking and a +2 STR bonus of protection of any sort of poisoning.

### 5.2.5 Palace Beverly Hills 

Derived from the Beverly Hills Hotel, of Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California, this hotel has 75 suites, and 8 bungalows. It is the pride and joy of the establishment and as a result charges commensurate prices. With a style that is not-quite art deco with various pastel pink and light greens throughout the the entire complex (looking rather like the after-effects of too much pink spumante mixed with a spinach and riccotta pie), and not-quite functionalist 1960s functionalism, and not-quite Disneyland, the Palace Beverly Hills somehow succeeds in generating a nauseating combination of the worst all three. Nevertheless, there is an impressive entrance with a extensive lobby and semi-covered dining area which backs onto a wading pools whose water curiously matches the colour-scheme of the building. Matching the style the furnishings throughout the hotel are the finest cane and ratten, especially the roofs of the bungalows which can generate an authentic feeling of being in a Pacific Island storm if the weather assists.

Palace Beverly Hills is three stories high, with thirty room on on the second and third floors and fifteen on the ground floor which also hosts the lobby, bar, and restaurant. Beyond the dining area, swimming pools, and bungalows is a sprawling golf course with so many electric carts scooting about that one would be forgiven the prime purpose of golf is to hit a ball and go for a walk. This said, many of the people at Palace Beverly Hills require such vehicles. Whether it is simply a matter of genetics, bad diet, or lack of exercise, the proportion of people who fall into the obese scale of the BMI is close to one hundred percent. Actually anyone staying here will soon find out that the local restaurant, "Lard Have Mercy", is a contributing factor. Here the historical food pyramid is inverted, so refined sugars, corn syrup, trans-unsaturated fats, etc provide a foundation which works its way up to minimal provision of vegetables, salads, and fruit. For Sundays its also becomes an church where one can possibly receive the most nutritious meal of the week - loaves and fishes. A hefty donation is requisite, as Rev. Telly Vangelist needs a new private jet. After all, how is he going to travel to those poor people in foreign countries and spread the good word? The Reverend Telly of course has their own secret and is always on the lookout for handsome young men to join him on these journeys where he can fulfil his sense of charity - "it is better to give than to receive". Training for such exotic journeys are often carried out in the Telly's bunga-bungalow. 

The only people found at the Palace Beverly Hills who don't fall into the WASP stereotype are the workers. The olive-skinned chef, Jim Balaya, is of Creole Louisiana background, and speaks English, French, and Spanish fluently. He is also surprisingly thin, given the food that he cooks and the reason for this is quite simple - he never eats a meal. Certainly he snacks all day on whatever is being prepared, but no-one has ever seen him sit down and eat a meal. Whilst one may assume that his grazing activities are sufficient what is unknown to almost all is that Jim keeps a secret stash of fresh fruit and vegetables in the restaurant's walk-in fridge, which he snacks on when nobody is looking. As much as he loves providing mountains of foie gras, the fluffiest white bread, dishes constructed out of chicken and pork fat, impossibly sweet pastries, and so forth, he is less of a fool that his customers. In fact, he is deliberately trying to kill them; so far four people at the hotel have suffered fatal heart attacks. One day a psychologist will discover that Jim's impoverished (and often hungry) childhood has led him to a position where he derives pleasure from watching the people that he despises most die from the culinary pleasure that he can provide them. This is in part inspired by the whisperings of "Cheesecake", the feminine fridge with a Fieldmarshall personality, who shares this extreme disdain for the well-to-do. Why 'Cheesecake'? Because everyone knows that revenge is a sweet dish best served cold.

"Please, Your Honor," whined Pauper William Nodes, 27, in a London court last week, "don't part me and the rat." The judge looked appraisingly at Nodes' pet rat in a cage on the barristers' table, frowned severely at Nodes. Clearing his throat he then did British Justice: "I sentence you, William Nodes, to six months in prison as an incorrigible rogue. The rat will be sent to a good home."
