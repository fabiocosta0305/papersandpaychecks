· Nile.com, Incorporated (the enemy) is an electronic commerce company
· Nile is trying to out-muscle Borderlands
· PCs will be recruited by the owner of Borderlands to investigate and hopefully break Nile.

· Older son – Stellan Border.  Kindly gentleman with extremely bad timing.  Will turn up unexpectedly when the PCs are busy, and then not be able to be found when they have time to talk to him.  Tries to avoid speaking ill of anyone, even his brother of whom he has suspicions.
· Younger Sun – Leoland Border.  Very pleasant and friendly.  Solid and well-built.  Excellent listener.  Secretly in the pay of Nile, and passing on inside information to them.

# Palaces of the Electrum Princess

## Introduction 

"Years ago the valley was green, and animals ran free through golden fields of grain", or so the story goes.

The princess Venice Novateló ruled over these peaceful campsites land and the people were secure and happy. They were happy campers. (She wasn't a real princess, but that didn't matter).

Then one day a real-estate developer driving a red Maserati appeared in the driveway of the princess' little bed and breakfast and almost overnight the campsites fell into development.

They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot. Now only pink hotels, serviced by big yellow taxis, and plenty of rumors remain, and what legends there are tell of a fabulous dreamcatcher is somewhere within the Palaces of the Electrum Princess.

# Fantasy Papers and Paychecks


# The cheerleader speciality class:

Able to perform gymnastics similar to that of a monk class in AD&D with the
special ability at higher levels called cleavage shake which works only on those
potentially attracted to buxom females. Save versus constitution or wisdom
(whichever is lower) or go into a drooling stupor which lasts for up to ten rounds
or until someone (usually a mate/spouse) slaps you for staring. Some GMs may add a
male gender version which has the special ability simple called abs involving the
male cheerleader showing bare mid-drift. All other effects are the same.

# Snail mail magic communications device(item):

This magical device can be constructed out of many different types of boxes that
vary in size or shape with the single requirement that they all have a slot in
them that is big enough for a single envelope/package to pass through. In action
this item will allow a player to send another player a wide array of missives or
small packages containing anything you desire. However this method of
communication is extremely slow compared to email (see other references in players
handbook) but can contain physical objects. Snail mail has a mind of its own and
there is a table of results each time you mail something. roll percentile dice and
consult the following table:

1-5% Your mail never arrives. it has gone into another dimension and will require a
arduous quest to potentially locate it
6-20% Your mail arrives, just at the wrong location. Roll percentile again where
anything above 10% results in the receiver keeping your mail forever.
21-95% your mail gets to it intended recipient. Roll percentile again to determine
condition. Results above 50% and the mail is unharmed. Otherwise divide by 10 and
the mail takes that many points of damage rounded down.
96-100% A monstrous creature called the mail-man is summoned who attacks after
issuing one of the following the statements “your postage is insufficient!”,
“mishandling mail is a federal offense!”, “overseas letters must be sent via
air-mail!" . He is a wild fiend dressed in very short pantaloons wearing a
distinctive looking circular hat that is enchanted to protect him from sleet, snow
and provides enhanced night vision. He is always armed with a wand of magic missile.

# The Door-to-Door wandering monster:

This terrible wandering monster will attack you at your home base, camp or even a
temporary stopping place if you stand somewhere too long. There are a number of
different variations of this beast but the effects are similar. Once approached you
must make a save vs intelligence or be ensnarled for 1-12 turns. You make continue
to make saves every turn with the of adding an additional temporary +1 cumulatively
to your intelligence every turn until you finally save or 12 turns have passed.
Varieties include a selection of religious zealots. This variety usually walks or
peddles up to you wearing a completely covering jacket and pantaloons (often
black)no matter how hot the temperature outside. They can also be wearing what
appears to be a black, flat noose tied around their necks. They always travel in
groups of at least 2 and will spend the time while you are ensnarled trying to
convert you to their religion. This can include pamphlets that contain information
that defies logic or reason.

Another version is salesman. This variety will attempt to pressure you during your
ensnarlment to purchase expensive items you don’t need that will frequently not
work. Even if you agree to purchase the items they are pushing they will continue to
tell you how wonderful the items are and what a great purchase you have made until
you save or the time runs out. roll percentile dice to determine what they are
selling. 1-10% a magic item that is supposed to clean your home, den, castle,
dungeon but usually just breaks during the first use. 11-40% A variety of potions
that when applied to your face/hair/body will increase your comliness by +3. This is
a usually harmless product but it will do nothing thats promised at all. 41-70%
Miraculous food products that you can sell to your friends so they can sell to their
friends. This will end up costing you all your accumulated wealth and you will end
up with a vault full of food and drink that will taste horrible and provide no more
nourishment than eating tree bark. all the while your charisma will drop -6 points
and your friends will avoid you and flee on seeing you coming. 71-100% candy. This
inisdious product is usually sold by what appears to be children. During your
ensnarlement they will tell you tales of woe that will make you feel bad if you
don’t give them all your loot. Save versus wisdom or give them whatever coinage you
have on you. Also, the candy has an addictive quality, especially the peanut butter
patties, that will cause you to seek out further Door-to-Door monsters looking for
the children who sell the cookies.

# Charles the Tall Intern

Level: 3
Character class: unknown

Charles the Tall Intern appeared one day at the coffee machine, emptied the pot into
a massive cup, slew a kobald, and went back to his desk. There, he sits all day
planning mighty sieges against distant kingdoms; his cow-orkers have no idea why.

That was three years ago. Since then, Charles the Tall's behavior has not changed,
although his shoulders are more slumped, and he visits the Little Adventurer's Room
more regularly.


# Crime and Punishment

"Please, Your Honor," whined Pauper William Nodes, 27, in a London court last week, "don't part me and the rat." The judge looked appraisingly at Nodes' pet rat in a cage on the barristers' table, frowned severely at Nodes. Clearing his throat he then did British Justice: "I sentence you, William Nodes, to six months in prison as an incorrigible rogue. The rat will be sent to a good home."
