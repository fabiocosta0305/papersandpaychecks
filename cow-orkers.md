**The cheerleader speciality class**

Able to perform gymnastics similar to that of a monk class in AD&D with the special ability at higher levels called cleavage shake which works only on those potentially attracted to buxom females. Save versus constitution or wisdom (whichever is lower) or go into a drooling stupor which lasts for up to ten rounds or until someone (usually a mate/spouse) slaps you for staring. Some GMs may add a male gender version which has the special ability simple called abs involving the male cheerleader showing bare mid-drift. All other effects are the same.

**Snail mail magic communications** 

by Fred

This magical device can be constructed out of many different types of boxes that
vary in size or shape with the single requirement that they all have a slot in
them that is big enough for a single envelope/package to pass through. In action
this item will allow a player to send another player a wide array of missives or
small packages containing anything you desire. However this method of
communication is extremely slow compared to email (see other references in players
handbook) but can contain physical objects. Snail mail has a mind of its own and
there is a table of results each time you mail something. roll percentile dice and
consult the following table:

1-5% Your mail never arrives. it has gone into another dimension and will require a
arduous quest to potentially locate it
6-20% Your mail arrives, just at the wrong location. Roll percentile again where
anything above 10% results in the receiver keeping your mail forever.
21-95% your mail gets to it intended recipient. Roll percentile again to determine
condition. Results above 50% and the mail is unharmed. Otherwise divide by 10 and
the mail takes that many points of damage rounded down.
96-100% A monstrous creature called the mail-man is summoned who attacks after
issuing one of the following the statements “your postage is insufficient!”,
“mishandling mail is a federal offense!”, “overseas letters must be sent via
air-mail!" . He is a wild fiend dressed in very short pantaloons wearing a
distinctive looking circular hat that is enchanted to protect him from sleet, snow
and provides enhanced night vision. He is always armed with a wand of magic missile.

**The Door-to-Door Wandering Monster**

by Fred

This terrible wandering monster will attack you at your home base, camp or even a temporary stopping place if you stand somewhere too long. There are a number of different variations of this beast but the effects are similar. Once approached you must make a save vs intelligence or be ensnarled for 1-12 turns. You make continue to make saves every turn with the of adding an additional temporary +1 cumulatively to your intelligence every turn until you finally save or 12 turns have passed. Varieties include a selection of religious zealots. This variety usually walks or peddles up to you wearing a completely covering jacket and pantaloons (often black) no matter how hot the temperature outside. They can also be wearing what appears to be a black, flat noose tied around their necks. They always travel in groups of at least 2 and will spend the time while you are ensnarled trying to
convert you to their religion. This can include pamphlets that contain information that defies logic or reason.

Another version is salesman. This variety will attempt to pressure you during your ensnarlment to purchase expensive items you don’t need that will frequently not work. Even if you agree to purchase the items they are pushing they will continue to tell you how wonderful the items are and what a great purchase you have made until you save or the time runs out. roll percentile dice to determine what they are selling. 1-10% a magic item that is supposed to clean your home, den, castle, dungeon but usually just breaks during the first use. 11-40% A variety of potions that when applied to your face/hair/body will increase your comliness by +3. This is a usually harmless product but it will do nothing thats promised at all. 41-70% Miraculous food products that you can sell to your friends so they can sell to their friends. This will end up costing you all your accumulated wealth and you will end up with a vault full of food and drink that will taste horrible and provide no more nourishment than eating tree bark. all the while your charisma will drop -6 points and your friends will avoid you and flee on seeing you coming. 71-100% candy. This inisdious product is usually sold by what appears to be children. During your ensnarlement they will tell you tales of woe that will make you feel bad if you don’t give them all your loot. Save versus wisdom or give them whatever coinage you have on you. Also, the candy has an addictive quality, especially the peanut butter
patties, that will cause you to seek out further Door-to-Door monsters looking for the children who sell the cookies.

## 3.1 The Pizza Computer by Shaun Hately

From actual experience. Proof positive that some things are *for* us, even if they have a twisted sense of humour.

"Hi, I ordered a pizza online yesterday for delivery at 9.30 last night. It never arrived. My order number is xxxxxxxxxxxx."
"One moment.... your order is scheduled for delivery at 9.30 this evening."
"Yeah. No. I ordered it for delivery for 9.30 last night."
"It's down for delivery this evening."
"I have the e-mail confirming the order in front of me. It says delivery at 9.30pm on 4/1/2018. That was yesterday."
"Let me open it up and have a look... you're right. My apologies. I don't know what happened. This is all automated."
"That's fine. But I'd like a refund."
"You don't just want the delivery this evening?"
"No."
(Bear in mind that I am fasting today which is why I was rather annoyed at my dinner not arriving last night. The food arriving at 9.30 this evening would be taunting me because I would not be allowed to eat it for another 10 or so hours, and I would have been without food for about 30 hours at the time of delivery.)
"All right... Um... it won't let me process a refund because there hasn't actually been a delivery yet, so the computer says there is nothing to refund. Are you sure you don't just want the delivery this evening?"
"No."
"OK... let me try and cancel the order.... it won't let me cancel the order, because it's already been accepted and it's in the queue. You know it really would be a lot easier if you just accepted the delivery this evening."
"No. That's not acceptable to me."
"Yeah, OK... Sorry. I understand. The computer doesn't understand though... let me try this... no... no.... no... sorry... no..."
"Look - I was probably going to order another pizza tomorrow night... can we transfer tonights order to then? Would that be easier?"
"Yes. Yes. Is that OK?"
"Yes, but I'd like a 7.30 delivery."
"No problem... OK.... done. Delivery for 7.30pm 6/1/2018 - you should receive an e-mail confirmation in a moment."
"Great."
"Oh..."
"What?"
"OK, now we have an order for 7.30 tomorrow night. And an order for 9.30 tonight."
"Am I paying for both orders?"
"I don't think so. But if I really understood how this software worked, I probably could have cancelled the order. OK - let me just check... OK. I've cancelled payment on tomorrow's order. And I'm comping it... OK... your pizza tomorrow will be free, so, even if they deliver tonight's pizza, you're only paying for one pizza."
"I really don't want tonight's pizza delivered. I cannot eat it. I want to be in bed before 9.30..."
"Ah... I could change the delivery time until earlier."
"You can change the delivery time? OK... change it until 7.30. I guess I'll stick it in the fridge or something."
"Done... oh... now we have an order at 7.30 tonight. An order at 9.30 tonight. And an order at 7.30 tomorrow night... OK - I can at least cancel... no, that's the order you want. That's the only one I can cancel... would you mind if I got my supervisor?"
"I think I'd really appreciate it if you got your supervisor."
"Hello... yes... I can see what is happening. But the computer isn't letting us do anything about it... OK - do you want tomorrow night's order?"
"Yes."
(By this point, I am craving pizza... yes, I want pizza tomorrow if I couldn't have it yesterday and I can't eat it today.)
"OK... I can issue a refund on your first order later this evening after it's been delivered at 9.30. The 7.30 order tonight and the 7.30 order tomorrow night are both complimentary. And I'll make a note that your next order is also complimentary... I think that's the best we can do."
"So I am getting four free pizzas? Two of which I don't want."
"Yes... sorry... I know this is a bit ridiculous."
"Yeah... don't worry. I know this isn't your fault. And I appreciate you both trying to fix it. And it's a pretty cool story."
"OK... enjoy your pizzas. Well, some of them anyway."


## 3.2 Charles The Tall, Daniel Callahan

Level: 3
Character class: unknown

Charles the Tall Intern appeared one day at the coffee machine, emptied the pot into
a massive cup, slew a kobald, and went back to his desk. There, he sits all day
planning mighty sieges against distant kingdoms; his cow-orkers have no idea why.

That was three years ago. Since then, Charles the Tall's behavior has not changed,
although his shoulders are more slumped, and he visits the Little Adventurer's Room
more regularly.

## 4.1 So You Want it Darker?

### 4.1.1 Papers & Paychecks in North Korea

Nearly all games of *Papers & Paychecks* are run with a high degree of tongue-in-cheek humour. There is however, a certain body of gamers who prefer their grim characters to face up to the horrors of the world. These are the sort who like to play *Paranoia*, for example, in 'straight' mode, or delight in their *Call of Cthulhu* investigators being driven mad by eldritch horrors from beyond the stars. Recognising that such people exist led us to explore the possibility - what is the most strange, totalitarian, authoritarian, and bureaucratic regime that exists on earth today? Whilst some places may have the dubious honour of winning a single metric among these dimensions, for purposes of consistency across the board, the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea is the winner. As a very unusual change of pace from the standard *Papers & Paychecks* game, 'So, You Want it Darker?' provides a researched account (including anonymous first-hand reports) from a setting that is nevertheless worthy of in-game exploration.

### 4.1.2 Geography

A description of the geography is hopefully a safe and non-controversial starting point. As a country, it is located in the northern half of the Korean peninsula, sharing a land border to the North with the People's Republic of China along the Amnok River, a short border along the Tumen River with Russia in the far north-east, and with the Republic of Korea (South Korea) in the south along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The length of the meandering land border with China is just over 1400km, the border with Russia is less than 20km, and that with South Korea is almost 240km.

To the west is the Yellow Sea and the northern extension, the Korean Bay, which connects to China. To the east is the Sea of Japan. The Yellow Sea and the Korea Bay are off the west coast and the Sea of Japan (known in North Korea as the East Sea of Korea) is off the east coast. There is over 3500 islands off the coast of North Korea, mostly along the western coastlines. The most significant collection is the Pansong Archipelago, which includes the largest island, Sinmi Island, which has an area fo some 50 square kilometres.

Over eighty percent of the country's area is mountainous, but the north and eastern part of North Korea are extremely so with the Hamgyong Range (north-east), Kaema Plateau (north, east), Kangnam (north, central, borders with China) Rangrim Mountains (north, east), T’aebaek Mountains (east to the South Korean border and beyond). The landscape ranges from several hundred metres to the country's highest point, the volcanic Baekdu Mountain, at over 2700m on the border with China.

Coastal plains on the east coast are minimal. On the west however, there is the substantial Pyongyang and Chaeryong plains. The north and eastern mountain ranges act as the source for the major rivers of North Korea which mostly run in a westerly direction. The longest is the Amnok River which runs for almost eight hundred kilometres forming the border with China, where it is known as the Yalu River. The second longest river, the Duman, is unusual insofar eastwards into the Sea of Japan. Although over 520km, it is almost entire unnavigable due to the moutainous terrain. The third longest, at c440km, is the Taedong River who flows NE-SW and runs through the country's capital, Pyongyang.

The climate is temperature and humid continental (Dwb) on the Köppen climate classification scheme in the far north-west third, whereas the rest of the country is classified warm and humid continental (Dwa). There are four distinct seasons, with warm summers and cold and dry winters. A short rainy season in summer is known as chagma, which is short, hot, and humid. The winters are notoriously cold, especially in the moutainous north and east regions. In winter the temperature range in the capital is typically from -3 to -13 degrees C., and in summer from 20 to 29.

Forest covers around 50% of the country, and has decreased substantially in recent decades due to various forms of land-clearing. Approximately 20% of the land is arable, with about 2-3% being used permanently for cropland and pasture. There is significant dispute over the prevalence of wildlife, with some considering the conditions dire, and others claiming a good amount especially in comparison to neighbouring parts of China and South Korea. Recorded mammals include various species of squirrel and chipmunk (e.g., Siberian chipmunk), mice and rats (e.g., Tanezumi rat), pika (e.g., northern pika) and rabbits (e.g., Korean hare, Manchurian hare), hedgehogs, shrews, bats, cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises), carivores (e.g., Eurasian lynx, Korean fox, Eurasian brown bears), and ungulates (e.g., Manchurian sika deer).

### 4.1.3 History and Politics

For much of its history Korea has been politically and culturally unified. It is true that over 2000 years ago the Gojoseon kingdom ruled the northern half of the peninsula, speaking a proto-Korean language known as Ye-Maek, whilst the south was controlled by a confederation of small states known as Jin. Growing out of the northern region was the Kingdom of Goruryeo whose name is cognate with 'Korea', and which lasted for several hundred years. At its height it controlled all of the northern and central part of the peninsula and parts of contemporary China and Russia, along with much of the south. As contemporaries in the far south there was the small Gaya confederacy, which nevertheless lasted some five hundred years, existing between larger Silla kingdom in the south-east and the Baekje kingdom in the south-west and western coastline. Silla absorbed Gaya in 562 CE, and then conquered Baekje in 660CE, despite the military support that Baekje received from Japan. Several years late Silla, with an alliance with the Chinese Tang dynasty, was able to conquer the Goguryeo kingdom as it was it was struggling with a succession conflict. Silla (often referred to Unified Silla) then controlled almost the entire peninsula for some 250 years until 935CE, with the exception of the northern regions of the contempory North Korea, which was under the control of the multi-ethnic Manchurian Balhae kingdom.

In the tenth century CE, a disaffected Silla general formed a short Later Baekje (aka Hubaekje) kingdom in the south-west. At around the same time, a new Goguryeo (aka Hugoguryeo or Taebong) was established in the north and central region. The latter eventually took over Hubaekje (930) and Silla (935), establishing a unified kingdom (or empire) throughout the penisula. This would last for over three hundred years (until 1392). The Hugoguryeo Empire defeated the Liao Empire on multiple occassions leading to the development of a cultural golden age in the 11th century CE with developments in scholarship and printing. Mongol invasions in the 13th century pressed the Hugoguryeo and brought much hardship to the land; eventually they sued for peace to the Great Yuan as a client state. As the Mongol Empire disintegrated and the Ming dynasty emerged the Goryeo court was split between those who supported the Ming and those who supported the Yuan. 

General Yi, who supported the Ming, overthrew the Goryeo dynasty and established the Kingdom of Great Joseon which lasted almost five hundred years, from 1392CE to 1897CE and made Confucianism the state religion. The Joseon period was enormously influential on contemporary Korean culture, establishing norms, language, etc The development of the Hangul alphabetic-syllabic script in the 15th century CE in the court of Sejong the Great could have transformed technological and scientific development, but it was opposed by the literary elite who preferred classical Chinese. In the late fifteenth century CE and sixteenth century CE, there was a series of factional conflicts known as the Korean literati purges, or 'sahwa' between two factions of the ruling scholarship class. In the late sixteenth century CE, with European weapons, the Japanese invaded but were eventually expelled following naval victories (with "turtle ships") and intervention by the Ming Chinese. In the seventeenth century the Manchurians engaged in two invasions forcing Joseon to become a tributary state of the Qing dynasty until 1894. 

In 1894 there was the Donghak Peasant Revolution which resulted in scores, if not hundreds, of thousands of peasants killed by the government and supported by the Qing dynasty. This intervention by the Qing was a breach of the Convention of Tientsin, and led to the Sino-Japanese war, which was decisively won by the Japanese who forced the end of Joseon's vassalage, leading to the short-lived Korean Empire. This lasted less than thirteen years before it was annexed by Japan following their victory in the 1905 Russo-Japanese War. Imperial Japanese rule remained in place until their defeat in 1945 when the country was divided between Soviet and American occupying forces along the 38th parallel (the latitude, almost comically, chosen by two US officers who used a map from *National Geographic* and wanted the capital, Seoul, to be on the U.S. side). The history of North Korea thus begins with the establishment of the Soviet Civil Authority in October 1945 and the Provisional People's Committee for North Korea in February 1946 with Kim Il-sung, an anti-Japanese guerrilla leader, as chair. The Provisional government instituted land reform reduced landlord's claims to the same as other civilians and major industries were nationalised. Whilst achieved without apparent bloodshed, some 400,000 fled to South Korea as refugees. 

With the Republic of Korea declared in the south and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea declared in the north, with both having military leaders, and both claiming to the legitimate government of the peninsula, war was inevitable. Three years later, with over four million deaths (mostly civilians) an armistice and the establishment of a UN-enforced demilitarised zone has ensured an uneasy peace since. The destruction of North Korea was massive, with almost every substantial building destroyed. Nevertheless North Korea recovered rapidly and by 1957 industrial production had recovered to pre-war levels, assisted by Chinese and Soviet aid. An attempt by the pro-Chinese (and Soviet supported) Yan'an faction to remove Kim Il-sung from leadership failed and political opponents to were subject to show trials, imprisonment, and execution. The industrial economy grew with the provision of (often unreliable) electricity to all homes by 1968, primary and secondary education, and a high level of urbanisation. All during this time there was low-level conflicts with the Republic of Korea; two notable incidents include the failed assasination of South Korea's president, Park Chung-hee, and the capture of the U.S. spy-ship, Pueblo.

During his rule Kim Il-sung developed a cult of personality exceeding that of Stalin, on which it was modelled, and rejected both the Soviet and Chinese models of Marxist state socialism, both of whom reduced their military, financial, and ideological support for the regime. Increasingly developing its own method and ideology, Juche, usually translated as "self-reliance", includes political independence, economic self-reliance, and an independent military. In 1982 these ideas where expressed in an authoritative form as "On the Juche Idea", written by Kim Jong-il, the son of Kim Il-sung. As a explicit depature from Marxist philosophy when concentrates on class conflict as the dynamic of history, Juche sees the primary conflict as human effort against nature, espouses an idealist rather than materialist ontology, and argues that it represents a new era of human thought. From 1997 onwards the official dating system counts Juche years from the year of Kim Il-sung's birth in 1912. Thus 2017 is "Juche 106". One notable effect of the adoption of "self-reliance" is that North Korea's GDP per capita, which had been equal and often slightly higher than that of the South until the mid-1970s, is estimated to be be 4.5% of that of the South ($1800 USD vs $39400 USD), as the latter has traded its way to economic prosperity and has given up military rule in favour of democracy.

Kim Il-sung died in 1994 and was replaced by his son Kim Jong-il as General Secretary of the governing Korean Workers' Party and chair of the National Defense Commission (NDC). Kim Jong-il's seventeen year rule was particularly notable for a major economic crisis and famine in the 1990s, caused by declining foreign aid, loss of trade partners, lack of critical capital equipment, and flooding. The famine, known as The Ardous March, resulted in several hundred thousand deaths by conservative estimates. Politically, in 1998 the the Supreme People's Assembly wrote the president's post out of the constitution and designated Kim Il-sung as the country's "Eternal President". Already recognised as the leader in Juche thought, Kim Jong-il further developed the idea of an independent military to the policy of "Songun", or "army first" in 1998, notably becoming a nuclear weapons power in 2006. The Songun policy was further developmed in the 2000s with the argument that the army represented the leading force of society, which some political historians have observed is another departure from Marxist orthodoxy which argues that this role belongs to the workers (or, in China's case. the peasants). As a historic achievement, of sorts, North Korea's military expenditure reached over 20% of the country's GDP under Kim Jong-il, the highest proportion in the world (the world average is 2.25%). 

As a minor, but successful departure, from Juche thought, a special industrial zone, the Kaesong Industrial Region, was established in 2002 with trade links to China and South Korea. This dovetailed with the "Sunshine Policy" advocated by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung to improve North-South relations and to allow South Korean companies to start projects in the North. The Kaesong Industrial Region however was closed in 2016 folllowing rising military tensions. Another example was the opening of the Mount Kumgang (Diamond Mountain) Tourist Region in 1998 which allowed South Korean and other foreign tourists to visit this part of North Korean territory. However it was closed in 2008 when a South Korean tourist was shot; the North claimed he had entered a military zone. In 2011, after many years of illness, Kim Jong-il died. The regime declared him "Eternal General Secretary" of the WPK and the "Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission", in keeping with the tradition of establishing eternal posts for the dead leaders. This two is a historic achievement of the country, being the world's only necrocracy - officially ruled by the dead, if in name only.

Kim Jong-il was replaced by his younger son Kim Jong-un, who took a usual array of positions heading the political, ideological, and military functions. Kim Jong-il had his uncle Jang Song-thaek executed in 2013, and it is believed that North Korean agents were behind the assassination of the eldest brother of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-nam, in Malayia in 2017. Like his predecessors, Kim Jong-il cultivates a personality cult, with satellite photos revealing in 2012 that a 500m message carved into a hillside in Ryanggang Province, reading, "Long Live General Kim Jong-un, the Shining Sun!". In 2013 a new set of economic measures were introduced which allowed enterprises to engage in a degree of autonomy, wage differentiation by management, improved levels of autonomy and family-harvest collection in the smaller collective farms, expansion of consumer goods, and increased trade with China. A show-case of gleaming modern buildings in 2014 were mockingly dubbed "Pyonghattan" by reporters at the time, expansion of the construction industry continues to this day. Despite some apparent improvements for the urban population, it was estimated by a UN report in 2018 that some 40% of the population, primarily rural, suffer from undernutrition. It is in this context that the future history of North Korea will be written.

### 4.1.4 Culture and Society 

The culture of Korea is described by its language, religion, arts, lifestyle, and norms. differentiated in contemporary times by the division between the Koreas resulting in some unusual, and increasingly unique, cultural expressions in North Korea. Insofar that the shared symbolic (audio and visual) values provide a the representation of cultural values, these are considered first. This section also includes various demographic information about North Korea which provide an adequate description of the everyday life experience of North Koreans.

As a language, Korean and Koreanic language family, is usually considered a contemporary language isolate, with suggestions that it may be part of the proposed Altaic language family is usually rejected, or the proposed Dravido-Korean-Japonic language family to be controversial - although there is simularity in vocabulry and grammar. Playing it safe, many linguistics place Korean in a Paleosiberian language family - a term of convenience to incorporate in a number of language isolates in the region. Within the Koreanic language family in its own right, Modern Korean is the only member with the exception of Jeju, spoken by less than ten thousand people in a island province of the same name south of peninsula. Modern Korean is derived from Middle Korean (from the 10th to 16th century's CE), and in turn from Old Korean (from the 4th to 10th century's CE), with the latter derived from the ancient languages of the peninsula and of southern Manchuria.

Korean is an agglutinative language; affixes are added ("glued") to words to change a word's meaning in a sentence or grammatical position. Sentence endings are also used, to indicate surprise, dispassionate acknowledgement of fact, agreement, rhetorical questions, and voluntary action, to give several common examples. The word order in the Korean language is subject-object-verb e.g., "Chin-Sun japchae eats". The writing style is the aforementioned Chosŏn'gŭl, invented by  King Sejong the Great, known in the South as Hangul. The alphabet consists of 40 characters; 19 consonants and 21 vowels, with the addition of . Letters are arranged syllabic blocks and are written left to right (they were traditionally written top to bottom, right to left). An interesting feature of the characters is the correlation between the shape of the letters and the and a representation of the mouth's position when they are pronounced. There are minor differences in lettering between North and South, and several dialects throughout the peninsula. Another minor difference is foreign-language word borrowings; North Korea has more Russian words, whereas South Korea has more English words. Furthermore a selection of Hanja characters (use of Chinese characters in the Korean language) is also taught in North Korean schools and universities.

North Korea is officially an atheist state where estimates suggest that approximately 2/3rds of the population are non-religious. Among those that do follow a religion (apart from Juche, of course) approximately 1 in 7 follow tradition Korean shaminism, 1 in 7 are part of the Chondoism faith ("Religion of the Heavenly Way), a neo-Confucion religion established in the early 20th century, approximately 1 in 20 are Buddhists, and there is a small number of Christians. Korean shaminism, also known as Muism or Sinism, incorporates ancestor worship, spirits of various scope and power, holistic considerations, and mediation in rituals of sacrifices, dance, song, and prayers, between the gods, the mu (shaman), and worshippers. The mu are ascetics who seek purity of body and man. Chondoism developed from the Donghak ("Eastern Learning") Confucian movement which opposed the encroachement of Western ideas, and carried the secular ideas of poverty alleviation, especially amont the peasants, and political stability. It is recognised by the North Korean government as being revolutionary, anti-imperialist, and is represented in the government through its own political party. The North Korean constitition does include freedom of religion and even the construction of religious buildings, but all within the caveat of protecting the state from foreign powers and ensuring social order. In effect this means that any religious organisation is, at best, closely monitored.

Religion also plays a role in the traditional crafts of North Korea, incorporating elements of historical shamanistic dance rituals,

## 5.2 Scenario: Palaces of the Silver Princess by Michael Cole

### 5.2.1 Introduction 

"Years ago the valley was green, and animals ran free through golden fields of grain", or so the story goes.

The princess Venice Novateló ruled over these peaceful campsites land and the people were secure and happy. They were happy campers. She wasn't a real princess, but that didn't matter because this is a postmodern story.

Then one day a real-estate developer driving a red Maserati appeared in the driveway of the princess' little bed and breakfast and almost overnight the campsites fell into development.

They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot. Now only pink hotels, serviced by big yellow taxis, and plenty of rumors remain, and what legends there are tell of a fabulous dreamcatcher is somewhere within the Palaces of the Electrum Princess.

# Crime and Punishment

"Please, Your Honor," whined Pauper William Nodes, 27, in a London court last week, "don't part me and the rat." The judge looked appraisingly at Nodes' pet rat in a cage on the barristers' table, frowned severely at Nodes. Clearing his throat he then did British Justice: "I sentence you, William Nodes, to six months in prison as an incorrigible rogue. The rat will be sent to a good home."
